The robot has four actions: pickup, putdown, stack, and unstack. The domain assumes a world where there are a set of blocks that can be stacked on top of each other, an arm that can hold one block at a time, and a table where blocks can be placed.

The actions defined in this domain include:

pickup: allows the arm to pick up a block from the table if it is clear and the arm is empty. After the pickup action, the arm will be holding the block, and the block will no longer be on the table or clear.

putdown: allows the arm to put down a block on the table if it is holding a block. After the putdown action, the arm will be empty, and the block will be on the table and clear.

stack: allows the arm to stack a block on top of another block if the arm is holding the top block and the bottom block is clear. After the stack action, the arm will be empty, the top block will be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will no longer be clear.

unstack: allows the arm to unstack a block from on top of another block if the arm is empty and the top block is clear. After the unstack action, the arm will be holding the top block, the top block will no longer be on top of the bottom block, and the bottom block will be clear. 
An example planning problem is: 
 You have 5 blocks. 
b2 is on top of b5. 
b5 is on top of b1. 
b1 is on top of b4. 
b3 is on top of b2. 
b4 is on the table. 
b3 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b4 should be on top of b3. 
A plan for the example problem is: 
 Pick up b4, put down b1, unstack b1 from b4, pick up b5, put down b5, unstack b5 from b1, pick up b2, put down b2, unstack b2 from b5, pick up b3, put down b3, and stack b4 on top of b3. 
Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You have 10 blocks. 
b2 is on top of b3. 
b7 is on top of b1. 
b10 is on top of b8. 
b3 is on top of b6. 
b6 is on top of b9. 
b5 is on top of b4. 
b9 is on top of b10. 
b4 is on top of b2. 
b1 is on the table. 
b8 is on the table. 
b7 is clear. 
b5 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b1 should be on top of b5. 
b2 should be on top of b10. 
b5 should be on top of b3. 
b7 should be on top of b4. 
b8 should be on top of b7. 
b9 should be on top of b2. 
b10 should be on top of b8. 
Can you provide an optimal plan, in the way of a sequence of behaviors, to solve the problem?
