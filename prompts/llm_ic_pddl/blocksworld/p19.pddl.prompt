I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 You have 5 blocks. 
b2 is on top of b5. 
b5 is on top of b1. 
b1 is on top of b4. 
b3 is on top of b2. 
b4 is on the table. 
b3 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b4 should be on top of b3. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is: 
 (define (problem BW-rand-5)
(:domain blocksworld-4ops)
(:objects b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 )
(:init
(arm-empty)
(on b1 b4)
(on b2 b5)
(on b3 b2)
(on-table b4)
(on b5 b1)
(clear b3)
)
(:goal
(and
(on b4 b3))
)
) 
Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You have 12 blocks. 
b3 is on top of b8. 
b7 is on top of b10. 
b2 is on top of b5. 
b10 is on top of b11. 
b6 is on top of b1. 
b12 is on top of b9. 
b5 is on top of b7. 
b4 is on top of b12. 
b11 is on the table. 
b1 is on the table. 
b9 is on the table. 
b8 is on the table. 
b6 is clear. 
b3 is clear. 
b2 is clear. 
b4 is clear. 
Your arm is empty. 
Your goal is to move the blocks. 
b5 should be on top of b10. 
b6 should be on top of b12. 
b7 should be on top of b4. 
b8 should be on top of b3. 
b9 should be on top of b2. 
b10 should be on top of b8. 
b11 should be on top of b7. 
b12 should be on top of b11. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations?
