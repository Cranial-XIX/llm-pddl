I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 You have a jack, a pump, a wrench, a boot, 2 hubs, 2 nuts, 2 flat tyres, and 2 intact tyres. 
The jack, pump, wrench, and intact tyres are in the boot. 
The boot is unlocked but is closed. 
The intact tyres are not inflated. 
The flat tyres are on the hubs. 
The hubs are on the ground. 
The nuts are tight on the hubs. 
The hubs are fastened. 
Your goal is to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs. Intact tyres should be inflated. The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is:

Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You have a jack, a pump, a wrench, a boot, 5 hubs, 5 nuts, 5 flat tyres, and 5 intact tyres. 
The jack, pump, wrench, and intact tyres are in the boot. 
The boot is unlocked but is closed. 
The intact tyres are not inflated. 
The flat tyres are on the hubs. 
The hubs are on the ground. 
The nuts are tight on the hubs. 
The hubs are fastened. 
Your goal is to replace flat tyres with intact tyres on the hubs. Intact tyres should be inflated. The nuts should be tight on the hubs. The flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump should be in the boot. The boot should be closed. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations?
