I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 3 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient3. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. 
Your goal is to make 1 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is:

  (and
     (contains shot1 cocktail1)

Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You have 1 shaker with 3 levels, 4 shot glasses, 3 dispensers for 3 ingredients. 
The shaker and shot glasses are clean, empty, and on the table. Your left and right hands are empty. 
The first ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail1 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient2. The second ingredient of cocktail2 is ingredient3. 
The first ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient1. The second ingredient of cocktail3 is ingredient2. 
Your goal is to make 3 cocktails. 
shot1 contains cocktail1. shot2 contains cocktail3. shot3 contains cocktail2. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations?
