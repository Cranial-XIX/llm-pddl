I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 You control 2 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 4 rooms and 6 balls. 
robot2 is in room3. robot1 is in room2. 
ball1 is in room3. ball2 is in room1. ball3 is in room3. ball4 is in room2. ball5 is in room4. ball6 is in room4. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room4. 
ball2 should be in room1. 
ball3 should be in room1. 
ball4 should be in room2. 
ball5 should be in room1. 
ball6 should be in room1. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is: 
 (define (problem gripper-2-4-6)
(:domain gripper-strips)

Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 You control 2 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 5 rooms and 2 balls. 
robot1 is in room1. robot2 is in room2. 
ball2 is in room1. ball1 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room5. 
ball2 should be in room4. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations?
