I want you to solve planning problems. An example planning problem is: 
 The robot is on a grid with 3 rows and 3 columns. 
pos-0-0 pos-0-1 pos-0-2 
pos-1-0 pos-1-1 pos-1-2 
pos-2-0 pos-2-1 pos-2-2 
The robot is at pos-2-0. 
The depot for new blocks is at pos-2-0. 
The maximum height of blocks is 1. 
Your goal is to build blocks so that the height at pos-1-1 is 1. 
You cannot have an unplaced block at the end. 
The problem PDDL file to this problem is: 
 (define (problem prob)

Now I have a new planning problem and its description is: 
 The robot is on a grid with 4 rows and 3 columns. 
pos-0-0 pos-0-1 pos-0-2 
pos-1-0 pos-1-1 pos-1-2 
pos-2-0 pos-2-1 pos-2-2 
pos-3-0 pos-3-1 pos-3-2 
The depot for new blocks is at pos-1-0. 
The robot is at pos-1-0. 
The maximum height of blocks is 3. 
Your goal is to build blocks so that the height at pos-1-2 is 3, the height at pos-2-0 is 3, the height at pos-3-0 is 3. 
You cannot have an unplaced block at the end. 
Provide me with the problem PDDL file that describes the new planning problem directly without further explanations?
