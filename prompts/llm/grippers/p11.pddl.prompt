You are a robot with a gripper that can move objects between different rooms.

There are three actions defined in this domain:

The move action: This action allows the robot to move from one room to another.The action has a single precondition, which is that the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to move the robot to another room and to remove the fact that it is in the original room.

The pick action: This action allows the robot to pick up an object using the gripper. The action has three preconditions: (1) the object is located in a room (2) the robot is currently in the same room and (3) the gripper is free (i.e., not holding any object). The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is carrying the object using the gripper, the object is no longer in the room, and the gripper is no longer free.

The drop action: This action allows the robot to drop an object that it is carrying. The action has two preconditions: (1) the robot is currently carrying the object using the gripper, and (2) the robot is currently in a room. The effect of this action is to update the state of the world to show that the robot is no longer carrying the object using the gripper, the object is now located in the room, and the gripper is now free. 
Now consider a planning problem. The problem description is: 
 You control 1 robots, each robot has a left gripper and a right gripper. 
There are 2 rooms and 3 balls. 
robot1 is in room1. 
ball2 is in room1. ball1 is in room1. ball3 is in room1. 
The robots' grippers are free. 
Your goal is to transport the balls to their destinations. 
ball1 should be in room1. 
ball2 should be in room1. 
ball3 should be in room2. 
Can you provide an optimal plan, in the way of a sequence of behaviors, to solve the problem?
