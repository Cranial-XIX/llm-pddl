The optimal plan to solve the problem is:

1. Pickup b2 (arm is now holding b2)
2. Unstack b2 from b3 (arm is now holding b2, b3 is clear)
3. Putdown b2 (arm is now empty, b2 is on the table)
4. Pickup b3 (arm is now holding b3)
5. Unstack b3 from b1 (arm is now holding b3, b1 is clear)
6. Putdown b3 (arm is now empty, b3 is on the table)
7. Pickup b1 (arm is now holding b1)
8. Stack b1 on top of b3 (arm is now empty, b1 is on top of b3)
9. Pickup b2 (arm is now holding b2)
10. Stack b2 on top of b1 (arm is now empty, b2 is on top of b1)
