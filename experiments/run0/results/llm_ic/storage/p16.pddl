2. Lift crate0 in container-0-0 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
3. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
4. Drop crate0 with hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to depot48-1-2 in depot48.
5. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
6. Lift crate1 in container-0-1 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
7. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
8. Drop crate1 with hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to depot48-2-1 in depot48.
