Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
2. Lift crate0 in container-0-0 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
3. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
4. Drop crate0 with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to depot48-2-4 in depot48.
5. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
6. Lift crate1 in container-0-1 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
7. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
8. Drop crate1 with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to depot48-2-3 in depot48.
9. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
10. Lift crate2 in container-0-2 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
11. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
12. Drop crate2 with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to depot48-2-2 in depot48.
13. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
14. Lift crate3 in container-0-3 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
15. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
16. Drop crate3 with hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to depot48-2-1 in depot48.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container store areas to the depot store areas using the available hoist. The hoist moves out to the load area, lifts a crate, goes into the depot, and drops the crate in a clear area. This process is repeated until all crates are in the depot.
