Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-1-3 to loadarea.
2. Lift crate0 in container-0-0 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
3. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
4. Drop crate0 with hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to depot48-1-1 in depot48.
5. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
6. Lift crate1 in container-0-1 in container 0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
7. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
8. Drop crate1 with hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to depot48-1-2 in depot48.
9. Go out with hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
10. Lift crate2 in container-0-2 in container0 with hoist0 from loadarea.
11. Go in with hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
12. Drop crate2 with hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to depot48-1-3 in depot48.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the available hoist. The hoist moves out to the loadarea, lifts a crate, goes into the depot, and drops the crate. This sequence is repeated until all crates are in the depot.
