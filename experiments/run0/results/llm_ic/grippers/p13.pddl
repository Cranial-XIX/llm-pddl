Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 moves from room1 to room3.
2. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room3.
3. Robot1 picks up ball2 with its right gripper in room3.
4. Robot1 moves from room3 to room1.
5. Robot1 drops ball1 in room1 with its left gripper.
6. Robot1 drops ball2 in room1 with its right gripper.

This plan ensures that both balls are transported to room1 in the most efficient way possible.
