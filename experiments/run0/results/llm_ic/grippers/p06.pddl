Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 moves from room2 to room1.
2. Robot2 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room1.
3. Robot2 moves from room1 to room3.
4. Robot2 drops ball1 in room3 with its left gripper.

This plan ensures that ball1 is transported from room1 to its destination, room3, in the most efficient way possible.
