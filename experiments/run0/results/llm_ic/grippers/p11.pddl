Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
3. Robot1 drops ball3 in room2 with its left gripper.

This plan is optimal because it involves the minimum number of actions necessary to achieve the goal. Since ball1 and ball2 are already in their destination room, they do not need to be moved. Only ball3 needs to be transported to room2.
