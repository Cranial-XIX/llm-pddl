Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot3 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot3 moves from room1 to room3.
3. Robot3 drops ball3 in room3 with its left gripper.
4. Robot1 moves from room4 to room2.
5. Robot1 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room2.
6. Robot1 moves from room2 to room4.
7. Robot1 drops ball4 in room4 with its left gripper.

In this plan, ball1 and ball2 are already in their destination room (room1), so no action is needed for them. Ball3 is moved from room1 to room3 by Robot3, and ball4 is moved from room2 to room4 by Robot1.
