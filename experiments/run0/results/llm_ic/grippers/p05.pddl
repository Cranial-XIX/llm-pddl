Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
3. Robot2 drops ball3 in room2 with its left gripper.

This plan is optimal because it involves the minimum number of actions necessary to achieve the goal. Since balls 1, 2, 4, and 5 are already in their destination room (room1), only ball3 needs to be moved to room2. Robot2, which is already in room1, can pick up ball3, move to room2, and drop it there.
