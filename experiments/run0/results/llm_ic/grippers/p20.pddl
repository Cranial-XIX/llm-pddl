Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
2. Robot1 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room2.
3. Robot1 stays in room2 as ball1 is already in its destination.
4. Robot2 moves from room1 to room3.
5. Robot2 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room3.
6. Robot2 stays in room3 as ball2 is already in its destination.

In this plan, each robot only needs to move once and pick up one ball, which is efficient and optimal. The other two robots (Robot3 and Robot4) are not needed in this scenario as there are only two balls to be moved and they are already in the correct rooms.
