Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot3 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room2.
2. Robot3 picks up ball3 with its right gripper in room2.
3. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
4. Robot3 drops ball2 in room1 with its left gripper.
5. Robot3 drops ball3 in room1 with its right gripper.
6. Robot3 moves from room1 to room2.
7. Robot3 picks up ball4 with its left gripper in room2.
8. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
9. Robot3 drops ball4 in room1 with its left gripper.

This plan ensures that all balls are in their correct rooms. Since each robot can hold two balls at once, this plan is optimal in terms of the number of steps.
