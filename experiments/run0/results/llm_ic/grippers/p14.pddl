Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 picks up ball2 with its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.
3. Robot1 drops ball2 in room4 with its left gripper.
4. Robot1 moves from room4 to room1.
5. Robot1 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room1.
6. Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.
7. Robot1 drops ball3 in room4 with its left gripper.

Note: Ball1 and Ball5 are already in their destination rooms (room2), and Ball4 is already in its destination room (room3), so no action is needed for these balls.
