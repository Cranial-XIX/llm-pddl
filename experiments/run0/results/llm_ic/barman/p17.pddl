Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal plan would be to make each cocktail one by one. Here is a sequence of behaviors to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand,
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands,
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into clean shaker1 using right hand,
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands,
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands,
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand,
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand,
8. Leave shot1 with right hand,
9. Shake cocktail1 with ingredient1 and ingredient3 in shaker1 using left and right hands,
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail1 into shot1 using left hand.

Repeat the above steps for each cocktail, replacing the shot glass number and the ingredients as needed. For shot8, since it only contains ingredient1, you can simply fill it with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands. 

Please note that after each cocktail is made, the shaker needs to be emptied and cleaned before making the next cocktail.
