Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail5 with ingredient2 and ingredient3 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail5 into shot1 using left hand.
11. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot2 with ingredients 3 and 1 for cocktail1.
12. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot3 with ingredients 1 and 2 for cocktail3.
13. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot4 with ingredients 1 and 2 for cocktail2.
14. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot5 with ingredients 3 and 1 for cocktail4.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails, steps 4 and 6 can be omitted from each repetition after the first.
