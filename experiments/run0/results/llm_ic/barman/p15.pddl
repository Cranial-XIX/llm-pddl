Given the complexity of the problem, the plan will be quite long. Here is a possible solution:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail4 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail4 into shot1 using left hand.
11. Clean shaker1 with left and right hands.
12. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot2 with ingredients 3 and 2 for cocktail1.
13. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot3 with ingredients 3 and 2 for cocktail5.
14. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot4 with ingredients 1 and 2 for cocktail3.
15. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot5 with ingredients 2 and 1 for cocktail6.
16. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot6 with ingredients 1 and 3 for cocktail2.
17. Grasp shot7 with right hand.
18. Fill shot7 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands.
19. Leave shot7 with right hand.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made, and that the shot glasses are cleaned after each use. It also assumes that the ingredients are always added in the order specified for each cocktail.
