Given the constraints and the goal, here is an optimal plan to make the 7 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand, fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands, pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand, clean shot1 with right and left hands, fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands, grasp shaker1 with left hand, pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand, leave shot1 with right hand, shake cocktail3 with ingredient2 and ingredient3 in shaker1 using left and right hands, pour shaker1 with cocktail3 into shot1 using left hand.

2. Repeat step 1 for shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5, and shot6, replacing the ingredients and cocktails as necessary according to the problem description.

3. For shot7, simply grasp shot7 with right hand and fill shot7 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made, which is not explicitly stated in the problem description but seems necessary given the constraints. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails, the plan could be optimized further by making multiple cocktails with the same ingredients in a row.
