Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal plan would be to make each cocktail one by one. Here is a sequence of actions to make the 7 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand,
   fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands,
   pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand,
   clean shot1 with right and left hands,
   fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands,
   grasp shaker1 with left hand,
   pour shot1 with ingredient1 into used shaker1 using right hand,
   leave shot1 with right hand,
   shake cocktail2 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands,
   pour shaker1 with cocktail2 into shot1 using left hand.

2. Repeat the same steps for shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5, and shot6, replacing the ingredients and cocktails accordingly.

3. For shot7, since it only contains ingredient3, the steps would be:
   Grasp shot7 with right hand,
   fill shot7 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands,
   leave shot7 with right hand.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made, and that the shot glasses are cleaned before they are filled with a new ingredient. It also assumes that the shaker has enough capacity to hold the ingredients for each cocktail.
