Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail2 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail2 into shot1 using left hand.
11. Clean shaker1 with left and right hands.
12. Repeat steps 1-11 for shot2 with cocktail3 (ingredient1 and ingredient2), shot3 with cocktail1 (ingredient3 and ingredient1), and shot4 with cocktail4 (ingredient2 and ingredient3).

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made, and that the shot glasses are cleaned after each use. This ensures that the ingredients do not mix between cocktails.
