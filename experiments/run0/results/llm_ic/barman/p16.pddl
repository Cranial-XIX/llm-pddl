Given the complexity of the problem, the plan will be quite long. Here is a possible solution:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient3 into clean shaker1 using right hand
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into used shaker1 using right hand
8. Leave shot1 with right hand
9. Shake cocktail1 with ingredient3 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail1 into shot1 using left hand
11. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot2 with cocktail5 (ingredient3 and ingredient2), shot3 with cocktail6 (ingredient3 and ingredient1), shot4 with cocktail4 (ingredient1 and ingredient2), shot5 with cocktail2 (ingredient1 and ingredient2), and shot6 with cocktail3 (ingredient3 and ingredient2)
12. For shot7, simply grasp shot7 with right hand and fill shot7 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If this is not necessary, steps 4 and 6 can be omitted for shots 2-6.
