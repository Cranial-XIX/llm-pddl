Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal plan would be to make each cocktail one by one. Here is a sequence of behaviors to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand, fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands, pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand, clean shot1 with right and left hands, fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands, grasp shaker1 with left hand, pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand, leave shot1 with right hand, shake cocktail6 with ingredient2 and ingredient3 in shaker1 using left and right hands, pour shaker1 with cocktail6 into shot1 using left hand.

2. Repeat the same steps for shot2 with ingredient1 and ingredient2 to make cocktail1.

3. Repeat the same steps for shot3 with ingredient1 and ingredient2 to make cocktail3.

4. Repeat the same steps for shot4 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 to make cocktail7.

5. Repeat the same steps for shot5 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 to make cocktail5.

6. Repeat the same steps for shot6 with ingredient3 and ingredient1 to make cocktail4.

7. Repeat the same steps for shot7 with ingredient2 and ingredient3 to make cocktail2.

8. Repeat the same steps for shot8 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 to make cocktail5.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails with the same ingredients, the plan could be optimized by making those cocktails consecutively.
