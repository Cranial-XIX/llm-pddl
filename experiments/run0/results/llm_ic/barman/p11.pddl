Sure, here is a plan to make the 5 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail4 with ingredient3 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail4 into shot1 using left hand.

Repeat steps 1-10 for shot2, shot3, shot4, and shot5, replacing ingredient1 and ingredient3 with the appropriate ingredients for each cocktail. For shot2, use ingredient1 and ingredient2 for cocktail5. For shot3, use ingredient3 and ingredient1 for cocktail2. For shot4, use ingredient3 and ingredient1 for cocktail3. For shot5, use ingredient1 and ingredient3 for cocktail1. 

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails, the plan could be optimized by skipping the cleaning step.
