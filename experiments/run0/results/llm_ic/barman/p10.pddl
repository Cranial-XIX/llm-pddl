Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient3 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail5 with ingredient3 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail5 into shot1 using left hand.
11. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot2 with cocktail3 (ingredient3 and ingredient1), shot3 with cocktail4 (ingredient2 and ingredient3), shot4 with cocktail2 (ingredient1 and ingredient2), and shot5 with cocktail1 (ingredient2 and ingredient1).

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails with the same ingredients, steps could be saved by making those cocktails consecutively.
