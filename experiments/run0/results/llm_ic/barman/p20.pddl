Given the complexity of the problem, the optimal plan would be to make each cocktail one by one. Here is a sequence of actions to make the 8 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand, fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands, pour shot1 with ingredient2 into clean shaker1 using right hand, clean shot1 with right and left hands, fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands, grasp shaker1 with left hand, pour shot1 with ingredient1 into used shaker1 using right hand, leave shot1 with right hand, shake cocktail6 with ingredient2 and ingredient1 in shaker1 using left and right hands, pour shaker1 with cocktail6 into shot1 using left hand.

2. Repeat the same steps for shot2, but with ingredient2 and ingredient3 for cocktail7.

3. Repeat the same steps for shot3, but with ingredient2 and ingredient3 for cocktail1.

4. Repeat the same steps for shot4, but with ingredient2 and ingredient3 for cocktail4.

5. Repeat the same steps for shot5, but with ingredient3 and ingredient2 for cocktail2.

6. Repeat the same steps for shot6, but with ingredient3 and ingredient2 for cocktail5.

7. Repeat the same steps for shot7, but with ingredient2 and ingredient1 for cocktail3.

8. For shot8, simply grasp shot8 with right hand, fill shot8 with ingredient3 from dispenser3 using right and left hands, and leave shot8 on the table.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made, and that the shot glasses are cleaned before they are filled with a new ingredient. This plan also assumes that the shaker has enough capacity to hold the ingredients for each cocktail.
