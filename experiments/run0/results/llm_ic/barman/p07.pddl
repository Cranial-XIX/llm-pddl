Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Grasp shot1 with right hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from dispenser1 using right and left hands.
3. Pour shot1 with ingredient1 into clean shaker1 using right hand.
4. Clean shot1 with right and left hands.
5. Fill shot1 with ingredient2 from dispenser2 using right and left hands.
6. Grasp shaker1 with left hand.
7. Pour shot1 with ingredient2 into used shaker1 using right hand.
8. Leave shot1 with right hand.
9. Shake cocktail4 with ingredient1 and ingredient2 in shaker1 using left and right hands.
10. Pour shaker1 with cocktail4 into shot1 using left hand.
11. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot2, using ingredient2 and ingredient1 to make cocktail1.
12. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot3, using ingredient2 and ingredient3 to make cocktail2.
13. Repeat steps 1-10 for shot4, using ingredient2 and ingredient1 to make cocktail3.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails, steps 4 and 6 can be omitted from the second, third, and fourth repetitions of the plan.
