Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b6 from b4.
2. Putdown b6.
3. Unstack b4 from b5.
4. Putdown b4.
5. Unstack b5 from b1.
6. Putdown b5.
7. Unstack b1 from b3.
8. Putdown b1.
9. Unstack b3 from b2.
10. Putdown b3.
11. Pickup b6.
12. Stack b6 on b2.
13. Pickup b1.
14. Stack b1 on b6.
15. Pickup b5.
16. Stack b5 on b3.

This plan assumes that the arm can only hold one block at a time and that a block cannot be placed on another block unless the lower block is clear. The plan also assumes that the goal is to have b1 on top of b6, b3 on top of b5, and b6 on top of b2, with all other blocks on the table.
