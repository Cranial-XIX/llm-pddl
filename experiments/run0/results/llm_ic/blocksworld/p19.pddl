Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b2 from b5
2. Putdown b2
3. Unstack b5 from b7
4. Putdown b5
5. Unstack b7 from b10
6. Putdown b7
7. Unstack b10 from b11
8. Putdown b10
9. Pickup b8
10. Stack b8 on b3
11. Pickup b10
12. Stack b10 on b8
13. Pickup b5
14. Stack b5 on b10
15. Pickup b7
16. Stack b7 on b4
17. Pickup b11
18. Stack b11 on b7
19. Pickup b12
20. Stack b12 on b11
21. Pickup b6
22. Stack b6 on b12
23. Pickup b9
24. Stack b9 on b2

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of actions. The blocks are first unstacked and put down in a way that allows for the desired final configuration. Then, the blocks are picked up and stacked in the order specified by the goal.
