Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b5 from b2.
2. Putdown b5.
3. Unstack b2 from b3.
4. Putdown b2.
5. Pickup b4.
6. Stack b4 on b3.
7. Pickup b5.
8. Stack b5 on b2.
9. Pickup b3.
10. Stack b3 on b5.

This plan will result in the desired configuration of blocks with b3 on top of b5 and b4 on top of b3.
