Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b3 from b1.
2. Putdown b3.
3. Unstack b4 from b2.
4. Putdown b4.
5. Unstack b1 from b4.
6. Putdown b1.
7. Pickup b4.
8. Stack b4 on b3.
9. Pickup b3 (which now has b4 on it).
10. Stack b3 on b2.
11. Pickup b2 (which now has b3 and b4 on it).
12. Stack b2 on b1.

Now, b1 is on top of b2, b2 is on top of b3, and b3 is on top of b4, as required.
