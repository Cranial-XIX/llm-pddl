Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b8 from b9.
2. Putdown b8.
3. Unstack b9 from b7.
4. Putdown b9.
5. Unstack b7 from b2.
6. Putdown b7.
7. Unstack b5 from b1.
8. Putdown b5.
9. Unstack b1 from b3.
10. Putdown b1.
11. Pickup b2.
12. Stack b2 on b7.
13. Pickup b1.
14. Stack b1 on b2.
15. Pickup b4.
16. Stack b4 on b1.
17. Pickup b9.
18. Stack b9 on b4.
19. Pickup b5.
20. Stack b5 on b6.
21. Pickup b3.
22. Stack b3 on b5.
23. Pickup b8.
24. Stack b8 on b3.
25. Pickup b7.
26. Stack b7 on b8.

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of actions. The blocks are first unstacked and put down to clear the way for the desired stacking order. Then, the blocks are picked up and stacked in the order specified in the goal.
