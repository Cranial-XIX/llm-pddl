Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b8 from b3.
2. Putdown b8.
3. Unstack b3 from b7.
4. Putdown b3.
5. Unstack b7 from b5.
6. Putdown b7.
7. Unstack b5 from b6.
8. Putdown b5.
9. Unstack b6 from b4.
10. Putdown b6.
11. Unstack b4 from b2.
12. Putdown b4.
13. Unstack b2 from b1.
14. Putdown b2.
15. Pickup b8.
16. Stack b8 on b7.
17. Pickup b1.
18. Stack b1 on b8.
19. Pickup b3.
20. Stack b3 on b5.
21. Pickup b2.
22. Stack b2 on b3.
23. Pickup b4.
24. Stack b4 on b2.

This plan assumes that the blocks can be stacked in any order and that the arm can reach any block. It also assumes that the blocks are stable when stacked and that the arm can hold any block.
