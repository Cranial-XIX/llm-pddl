Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b7 from b1
2. Putdown b7
3. Unstack b2 from b3
4. Putdown b2
5. Unstack b3 from b6
6. Putdown b3
7. Unstack b6 from b9
8. Putdown b6
9. Unstack b9 from b10
10. Putdown b9
11. Unstack b5 from b4
12. Putdown b5
13. Unstack b4 from b2
14. Putdown b4
15. Pickup b1
16. Stack b1 on b5
17. Pickup b2
18. Stack b2 on b10
19. Pickup b5
20. Stack b5 on b3
21. Pickup b7
22. Stack b7 on b4
23. Pickup b8
24. Stack b8 on b7
25. Pickup b9
26. Stack b9 on b2
27. Pickup b10
28. Stack b10 on b8

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved one at a time and that the arm can only hold one block at a time. The plan also assumes that the blocks are not stacked or unstacked unless necessary to achieve the goal state.
