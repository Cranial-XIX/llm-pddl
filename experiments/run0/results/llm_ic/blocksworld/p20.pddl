Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b11 from b4
2. Putdown b11
3. Unstack b4 from b10
4. Putdown b4
5. Unstack b10 from b3
6. Putdown b10
7. Unstack b3 from b9
8. Putdown b3
9. Unstack b1 from b12
10. Putdown b1
11. Unstack b12 from b2
12. Putdown b12
13. Pickup b6
14. Stack b6 on b2
15. Pickup b1
16. Stack b1 on b6
17. Pickup b10
18. Stack b10 on b1
19. Pickup b9
20. Stack b9 on b10
21. Pickup b8
22. Stack b8 on b9
23. Pickup b12
24. Stack b12 on b8
25. Pickup b11
26. Stack b11 on b12
27. Pickup b3
28. Stack b3 on b7
29. Pickup b5
30. Stack b5 on b3

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of actions and that the arm can only hold one block at a time. The plan may vary depending on the specific constraints of the problem.
