Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b7 from b8.
2. Putdown b7.
3. Unstack b8 from b1.
4. Putdown b8.
5. Unstack b1 from b6.
6. Putdown b1.
7. Unstack b6 from b4.
8. Putdown b6.
9. Pickup b4.
10. Stack b4 on b7.
11. Pickup b6.
12. Stack b6 on b4.
13. Pickup b5.
14. Stack b5 on b6.
15. Pickup b1.
16. Stack b1 on b3.
17. Pickup b7.
18. Stack b7 on b1.
19. Pickup b8.
20. Stack b8 on b2.
21. Pickup b3.
22. Stack b3 on b2.

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of actions. The blocks are first unstacked and put down to clear the way for the desired configuration. Then, the blocks are picked up and stacked in the order specified by the goal.
