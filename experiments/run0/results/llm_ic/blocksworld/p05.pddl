Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b4 from b1.
2. Putdown b4.
3. Unstack b1 from b2.
4. Putdown b1.
5. Unstack b2 from b3.
6. Putdown b2.
7. Pickup b1.
8. Stack b1 on b3.
   
This plan will result in b1 being on top of b3 and b3 being on top of b5, which is the desired goal state.
