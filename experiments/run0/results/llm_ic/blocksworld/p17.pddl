Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b3 from b4
2. Putdown b3
3. Unstack b4 from b10
4. Putdown b4
5. Unstack b10 from b7
6. Putdown b10
7. Unstack b7 from b8
8. Putdown b7
9. Unstack b8 from b1
10. Putdown b8
11. Unstack b1 from b11
12. Putdown b1
13. Pickup b11
14. Stack b11 on b1
15. Pickup b10
16. Stack b10 on b9
17. Pickup b9
18. Stack b9 on b5
19. Pickup b5
20. Stack b5 on b4
21. Pickup b6
22. Stack b6 on b10
23. Pickup b7
24. Stack b7 on b3
25. Pickup b2
26. Stack b2 on b7

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of actions. The plan may vary depending on the specific constraints of the problem.
