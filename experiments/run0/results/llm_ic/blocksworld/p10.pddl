Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b6 from b3.
2. Putdown b6.
3. Unstack b4 from b7.
4. Putdown b4.
5. Unstack b2 from b5.
6. Putdown b2.
7. Pickup b1.
8. Stack b1 on b7.
9. Pickup b4.
10. Stack b4 on b1.
11. Pickup b2.
12. Stack b2 on b5.
13. Pickup b3.
14. Stack b3 on b2.
15. Pickup b7 (with b1 and b4 on top).
16. Stack b7 on b3 (with b1 and b4 on top).
17. Pickup b5 (with b2 on top).
18. Stack b5 on b6.
19. Pickup b7 (with b1, b4, b3 on top).
20. Stack b7 on b5 (with b1, b4, b3 on top).

This plan assumes that the arm can carry more than one block at a time if they are already stacked. If the arm can only carry one block at a time, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
