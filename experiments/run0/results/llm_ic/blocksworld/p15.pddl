Given the complexity of the problem, it's difficult to provide an optimal plan without using a planning algorithm. However, here's a possible sequence of actions that could solve the problem:

1. Unstack b9 from b2
2. Putdown b9
3. Unstack b2 from b10
4. Putdown b2
5. Unstack b10 from b7
6. Putdown b10
7. Unstack b7 from b4
8. Putdown b7
9. Unstack b4 from b8
10. Putdown b4
11. Unstack b8 from b6
12. Putdown b8
13. Unstack b6 from b3
14. Putdown b6
15. Unstack b3 from b1
16. Putdown b3
17. Unstack b1 from b5
18. Putdown b1
19. Pickup b2
20. Stack b2 on b1
21. Pickup b3
22. Stack b3 on b10
23. Pickup b4
24. Stack b4 on b7
25. Pickup b6
26. Stack b6 on b8
27. Pickup b8
28. Stack b8 on b2
29. Pickup b9
30. Stack b9 on b4
31. Pickup b10
32. Stack b10 on b9

This plan assumes that the blocks can be stacked in any order, as long as the final configuration matches the goal. If there are additional constraints (e.g., certain blocks must be moved before others), the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
