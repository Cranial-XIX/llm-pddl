Sure, here is a possible plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b8 from b6.
2. Putdown b8.
3. Unstack b6 from b9.
4. Putdown b6.
5. Unstack b9 from b5.
6. Putdown b9.
7. Unstack b5 from b2.
8. Putdown b5.
9. Unstack b2 from b3.
10. Putdown b2.
11. Unstack b3 from b1.
12. Putdown b3.
13. Unstack b1 from b4.
14. Putdown b1.
15. Pickup b8.
16. Stack b8 on b7.
17. Pickup b4.
18. Stack b4 on b8.
19. Pickup b6.
20. Stack b6 on b4.
21. Pickup b1.
22. Stack b1 on b6.
23. Pickup b3.
24. Stack b3 on b1.
25. Pickup b5.
26. Stack b5 on b3.
27. Pickup b2.
28. Stack b2 on b5.
29. Pickup b9.
30. Stack b9 on b2.

This plan assumes that the arm can only hold one block at a time and that a block cannot be placed on another block unless the lower block is clear. The plan also assumes that the blocks are sturdy enough to support the weight of the blocks stacked on top of them.
