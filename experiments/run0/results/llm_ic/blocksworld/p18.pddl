This is a complex problem and there are many possible solutions. Here is one possible plan:

1. Unstack b10 from b2
2. Putdown b10
3. Unstack b2 from b5
4. Putdown b2
5. Unstack b5 from b3
6. Putdown b5
7. Unstack b3 from b6
8. Putdown b3
9. Unstack b6 from b7
10. Putdown b6
11. Unstack b7 from b1
12. Putdown b7
13. Unstack b1 from b9
14. Putdown b1
15. Unstack b9 from b11
16. Putdown b9
17. Pickup b4
18. Stack b4 on b11
19. Pickup b1
20. Stack b1 on b4
21. Pickup b7
22. Stack b7 on b2
23. Pickup b3
24. Stack b3 on b7
24. Pickup b8
25. Stack b8 on b3
26. Pickup b11
27. Stack b11 on b8
28. Pickup b6
29. Stack b6 on b5
30. Pickup b10
31. Stack b10 on b9

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved in a way that minimizes the number of moves and that the arm can only hold one block at a time. The plan may vary depending on the specific constraints of the problem.
