Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot 2 paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-2.
4. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot 2 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-3.

Meanwhile,

7. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot 1 paints tile_1-3 white.
9. Robot 1 moves right to tile_1-4.
10. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot 1 paints tile_1-4 black.
12. Robot 1 moves down to tile_2-4.

Then,

13. Robot 2 moves down to tile_2-1.
14. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot 2 paints tile_2-1 black.
16. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-2.
17. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
18. Robot 2 paints tile_2-2 white.
19. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-3.

At the same time,

20. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
21. Robot 1 paints tile_2-4 white.
22. Robot 1 moves left to tile_2-3.
23. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
24. Robot 1 paints tile_2-3 black.

This pattern continues until all tiles are painted as per the goal. The robots alternate colors and directions to avoid stepping on painted tiles.
