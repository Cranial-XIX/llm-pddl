Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Robot 1 starts at tile_5-3 and Robot 2 starts at tile_1-5. 

1. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot 1 paints tile_4-3 white.
3. Robot 1 moves left to tile_5-2.
4. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot 1 paints tile_4-2 black.
6. Robot 1 moves left to tile_5-1.
7. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot 1 paints tile_4-1 white.
9. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-2.
10. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot 1 paints tile_5-2 black.
12. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-3.
13. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot 1 paints tile_5-3 white.
15. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-4.
16. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot 1 paints tile_5-4 black.
18. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-5.
19. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
20. Robot 1 paints tile_5-5 white.

Meanwhile, Robot 2 will start painting from tile_1-5 to tile_1-1 and then move down row by row until it reaches tile_3-5.

21. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
22. Robot 2 paints tile_1-5 white.
23. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-4.
24. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
25. Robot 2 paints tile_1-4 black.
26. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-3.
27. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
28. Robot 2 paints tile_1-3 white.
29. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-2.
30. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
31. Robot 2 paints tile_1-2 black.
32. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-1.
33. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
34. Robot 2 paints tile_1-1 white.
35. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-2.
36. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
37. Robot 2 paints tile_2-2 black.
38. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-3.
39. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
40. Robot 2 paints tile_2-3 white.
41. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-4.
42. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
43. Robot 2 paints tile_2-4 black.
44. Robot 2 moves right to tile_1-5.
45. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
46. Robot 2 paints tile_2-5 white.
47. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-4.
48. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
49. Robot 2 paints tile_3-4 black.
50. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-3.
51. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
52. Robot 2 paints tile_3-3 white.
53. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-2.
54. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
55. Robot 2 paints tile_3-2 black.
56. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-1.
57. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
58. Robot 2 paints tile_3-1 white.

This plan will result in the desired pattern of alternating black and white tiles.
