Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
3. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-1.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.
9. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-2.
10. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-3.
11. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-4.
12. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
13. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.

14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot2 paints tile_5-2 black.
16. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-1.
17. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
18. Robot2 paints tile_5-1 white.
19. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-2.
20. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-3.
21. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
22. Robot2 paints tile_5-3 black.
23. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-4.
24. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
25. Robot2 paints tile_5-4 white.

The remaining tiles can be painted by the robots moving up and down the rows, alternating colors as they go. The robots should move in a zigzag pattern to avoid stepping on painted tiles. For example, after painting the first row, Robot1 should move down to the second row and paint from right to left, then move down to the third row and paint from left to right, and so on. Similarly, Robot2 should move up to the fourth row after painting the fifth row, and continue in a zigzag pattern.
