Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 moves down to tile_1-5.
3. Robot1 paints tile_1-5 white.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-4.
6. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-3.
9. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-2.
12. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-1.
15. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 can start painting from its position:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_3-3 white.
3. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
4. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-4.
5. Robot2 paints tile_3-4 black.
6. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
7. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-5.
8. Robot2 paints tile_3-5 white.
9. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
10. Robot2 moves left to tile_3-2.
11. Robot2 paints tile_3-2 black.
12. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
13. Robot2 moves left to tile_3-1.
14. Robot2 paints tile_3-1 white.

After this, both robots can continue painting the remaining tiles in a similar alternating pattern. The robots should always change their spray gun color to the color of the next tile they are going to paint, move to the next tile, and then paint it. They should continue this process until all tiles are painted as per the desired pattern.
