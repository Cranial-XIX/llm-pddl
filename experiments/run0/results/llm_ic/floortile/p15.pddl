Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 moves down to tile_4-4.
3. Robot1 paints tile_3-4 white.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-3.
6. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 black.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-2.
9. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 white.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-1.
12. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 black.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 moves down to tile_5-1.
15. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 white.

Now, let's move to Robot2:

16. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot2 moves up to tile_4-5.
18. Robot2 paints tile_5-5 black.
19. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
20. Robot2 moves left to tile_4-4.
21. Robot2 paints tile_5-4 white.
22. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
23. Robot2 moves left to tile_4-3.
24. Robot2 paints tile_5-3 black.
25. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
26. Robot2 moves left to tile_4-2.
27. Robot2 paints tile_5-2 white.
28. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
29. Robot2 moves left to tile_4-1.
30. Robot2 paints tile_5-1 black.

This plan will continue in this pattern, alternating between white and black, until all tiles are painted as per the desired pattern.
