Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Robot 1:
1. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot 1 moves down to tile_1-3.
3. Robot 1 paints tile_1-2 white.
4. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot 1 paints tile_1-3 black.
6. Robot 1 moves down to tile_2-3.
7. Robot 1 paints tile_2-2 black.
8. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
9. Robot 1 paints tile_2-3 white.

Robot 2:
1. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot 2 moves left to tile_3-3.
3. Robot 2 paints tile_3-4 black.
4. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot 2 paints tile_3-3 white.
6. Robot 2 moves left to tile_3-2.
7. Robot 2 paints tile_3-2 white.
8. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
9. Robot 2 paints tile_3-1 black.
10. Robot 2 moves down to tile_4-2.
11. Robot 2 paints tile_4-3 black.
12. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
13. Robot 2 paints tile_4-2 white.
14. Robot 2 moves left to tile_4-1.
15. Robot 2 paints tile_4-1 white.
16. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot 2 paints tile_4-0 black.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot moves onto a painted tile.
