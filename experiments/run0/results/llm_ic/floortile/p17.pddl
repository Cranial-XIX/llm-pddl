Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-3.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
9. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-4.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.
12. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-5.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_1-5 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start from the top right corner and move left, alternating colors as it goes:

15. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
16. Robot2 moves down to tile_1-5.
17. Robot2 paints tile_2-5 black.
18. Robot2 moves left to tile_2-4.
19. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
20. Robot2 paints tile_2-4 white.
21. Robot2 moves left to tile_2-3.
22. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
23. Robot2 paints tile_2-3 black.
24. Robot2 moves left to tile_2-2.
25. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
26. Robot2 paints tile_2-2 white.
27. Robot2 moves left to tile_2-1.
28. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
29. Robot2 paints tile_2-1 black.

This pattern continues until all tiles are painted according to the desired pattern. The robots will need to alternate their spray gun colors each time they move to a new tile.
