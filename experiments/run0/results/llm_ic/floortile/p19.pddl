Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 moves up to tile_5-1.
3. Robot1 paints tile_6-1 black.
4. Robot1 moves right to tile_5-2.
5. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
6. Robot1 paints tile_6-2 white.

Meanwhile,

7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot2 moves up to tile_5-2.
9. Robot2 paints tile_6-2 white.
10. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-3.
11. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
12. Robot2 paints tile_6-3 black.

This pattern continues until all tiles are painted according to the pattern. The robots alternate colors and move right, painting the tile behind them with the correct color. They continue this pattern, moving up a row when they reach the end of the current row, until all tiles are painted.
