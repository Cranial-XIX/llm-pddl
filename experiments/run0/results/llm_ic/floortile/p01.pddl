Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot1 moves right to tile_4-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_4-2 white.

Simultaneously,

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_4-3 black.
3. Robot2 moves left to tile_4-2.

Then,

6. Robot1 moves right to tile_4-3.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_4-3 black.
9. Robot1 moves up to tile_3-3.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.
12. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-2.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
15. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-1.
16. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.

Simultaneously,

4. Robot2 moves up to tile_3-2.
5. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
6. Robot2 paints tile_3-2 white.
7. Robot2 moves left to tile_3-1.
8. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
9. Robot2 paints tile_3-1 black.
10. Robot2 moves up to tile_2-1.
11. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
12. Robot2 paints tile_2-1 white.
13. Robot2 moves right to tile_2-2.
14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot2 paints tile_2-2 black.

Then,

18. Robot1 moves up to tile_2-1.
19. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
20. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 black.
21. Robot1 moves right to tile_2-2.
22. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
23. Robot1 paints tile_2-2 white.
24. Robot1 moves right to tile_2-3.
25. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
26. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 black.

Simultaneously,

16. Robot2 moves right to tile_2-3.
17. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
18. Robot2 paints tile_2-3 white.
19. Robot2 moves up to tile_1-3.
20. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
21. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 black.
22. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-2.
23. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
24. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 white.
25. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-1.
26. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
27. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 black.

Finally,

27. Robot1 moves up to tile_1-3.
28. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
29. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
30. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-2.
31. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
32. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
33. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-1.
34. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
35. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the desired pattern, and no robot steps on a painted tile.
