Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
4. Robot2 moves right to tile_1-2.
5. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
7. Robot2 moves right to tile_1-3.
8. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 white.

Meanwhile, 

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 black.
3. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
4. Robot1 moves left to tile_2-2.
5. Robot1 paints tile_2-2 white.
6. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
7. Robot1 moves left to tile_2-1.
8. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 black.

After that, Robot2 moves down to tile_2-1 and Robot1 moves down to tile_3-3 and they repeat the same sequence of actions for the remaining rows. 

For the third row:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_3-1 white.
3. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
4. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-2.
5. Robot2 paints tile_3-2 black.
6. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
7. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-3.
8. Robot2 paints tile_3-3 white.

Meanwhile, 

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-3 black.
3. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
4. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-2.
5. Robot1 paints tile_4-2 white.
6. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
7. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-1.
8. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 black.

This way, the robots will paint the tiles in the desired pattern.
