Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.
3. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
6. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-1.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start from the bottom:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot2 moves right to tile_4-2.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_4-2 white.
6. Robot2 moves right to tile_4-3.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_4-3 black.
9. Robot2 moves up to tile_5-1.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot2 paints tile_5-1 white.
12. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-2.
13. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot2 paints tile_5-2 black.
15. Robot2 moves right to tile_5-3.
16. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot2 paints tile_5-3 white.

After Robot1 finishes painting the third row, it will move up to the second row:

9. Robot1 moves up to tile_2-3.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 black.
12. Robot1 moves left to tile_2-2.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_2-2 white.
15. Robot1 moves left to tile_2-1.
16. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 black.

Finally, Robot1 will move up to the first row:

18. Robot1 moves up to tile_1-3.
19. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
20. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
21. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-2.
22. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
23. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
24. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-1.
25. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
26. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot steps on a painted tile.
