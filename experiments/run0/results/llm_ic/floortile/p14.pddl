Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Robot 1 starts at tile_2-2 and Robot 2 starts at tile_5-4. 

1. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot 1 paints tile_2-1 white.
3. Robot 1 moves left to tile_2-1.
4. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot 1 paints tile_1-1 black.
6. Robot 1 moves up to tile_1-1.
7. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot 1 paints tile_1-2 white.
9. Robot 1 moves right to tile_1-2.
10. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot 1 paints tile_1-3 black.
12. Robot 1 moves right to tile_1-3.
13. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot 1 paints tile_1-4 white.
15. Robot 1 moves right to tile_1-4.
16. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot 1 paints tile_1-5 black.
18. Robot 1 moves right to tile_1-5.

Meanwhile, Robot 2 will start painting from tile_5-4:

1. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot 2 paints tile_5-3 black.
3. Robot 2 moves left to tile_5-3.
4. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot 2 paints tile_5-2 white.
6. Robot 2 moves left to tile_5-2.
7. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot 2 paints tile_5-1 black.
9. Robot 2 moves left to tile_5-1.
10. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot 2 paints tile_4-1 white.
12. Robot 2 moves down to tile_4-1.
13. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot 2 paints tile_4-2 black.
15. Robot 2 moves right to tile_4-2.
16. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot 2 paints tile_4-3 white.
18. Robot 2 moves right to tile_4-3.

This pattern continues until all tiles are painted according to the pattern. The robots alternate between white and black as they move across the tiles.
