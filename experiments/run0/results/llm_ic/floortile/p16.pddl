Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Robot 1 starts at tile_4-1 and Robot 2 starts at tile_0-3. 

1. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_4-1 black.
2. Robot 1 moves right to tile_4-2.
3. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_4-2 white.
4. Robot 1 moves right to tile_4-3.
5. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_4-3 black.
6. Robot 1 moves right to tile_4-4.
7. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_4-4 white.
8. Robot 1 moves right to tile_4-5.
9. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_4-5 black.
10. Robot 1 moves down to tile_5-1.
11. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_5-1 white.
12. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-2.
13. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_5-2 black.
14. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-3.
15. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_5-3 white.
16. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-4.
17. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_5-4 black.
18. Robot 1 moves right to tile_5-5.
19. Robot 1 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_5-5 white.

Meanwhile, Robot 2 will paint the upper tiles:

1. Robot 2 moves up to tile_0-2.
2. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot 2 moves right to tile_0-3.
4. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_1-2 black.
5. Robot 2 moves right to tile_0-4.
6. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_1-3 white.
7. Robot 2 moves right to tile_0-5.
8. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_1-4 black.
9. Robot 2 moves down to tile_1-5.
10. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_1-5 white.
11. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-4.
12. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_2-4 black.
13. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-3.
14. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_2-3 white.
15. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-2.
16. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_2-2 black.
17. Robot 2 moves left to tile_1-1.
18. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_2-1 white.
19. Robot 2 moves down to tile_2-1.
20. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_3-1 black.
21. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-2.
22. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_3-2 white.
23. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-3.
24. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_3-3 black.
25. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-4.
26. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to white and paints tile_3-4 white.
27. Robot 2 moves right to tile_2-5.
28. Robot 2 changes its spray gun color to black and paints tile_3-5 black.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot steps on a painted tile.
