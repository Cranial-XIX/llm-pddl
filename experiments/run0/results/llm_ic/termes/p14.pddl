Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-1-0 (depot).
2. Move to pos-2-0.
3. Place the block at pos-2-0.
4. Move back to pos-1-0 (depot).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 three more times to build the height at pos-2-0 to 4.

6. Create a block at pos-1-0 (depot).
7. Move to pos-3-0.
8. Place the block at pos-3-0.
9. Move back to pos-1-0 (depot).
10. Repeat steps 6-9 two more times to build the height at pos-3-0 to 3.

11. Create a block at pos-1-0 (depot).
12. Move to pos-3-1.
13. Place the block at pos-3-1.
14. Move back to pos-1-0 (depot).
15. Repeat steps 11-14 two more times to build the height at pos-3-1 to 3.

16. Create a block at pos-1-0 (depot).
17. Move to pos-3-2.
18. Place the block at pos-3-2.
19. Move back to pos-1-0 (depot).
20. Repeat steps 16-19 three more times to build the height at pos-3-2 to 4.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the required heights at the specified positions without having an unplaced block at the end.
