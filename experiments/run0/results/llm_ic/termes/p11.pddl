Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-1-0 (the depot).
2. Move to pos-1-1.
3. Move to pos-1-2.
4. Place the block at pos-1-2. (The height at pos-1-2 is now 1)

5. Move back to pos-1-1.
6. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
7. Create another block at pos-1-0.
8. Move to pos-1-1.
9. Move to pos-1-2.
10. Place the block at pos-1-2. (The height at pos-1-2 is now 2)

11. Move back to pos-1-1.
12. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
13. Create another block at pos-1-0.
14. Move to pos-1-1.
15. Move to pos-1-2.
16. Place the block at pos-1-2. (The height at pos-1-2 is now 3)

17. Move back to pos-1-1.
18. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
19. Create another block at pos-1-0.
20. Move to pos-2-0.
21. Place the block at pos-2-0. (The height at pos-2-0 is now 1)

22. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
23. Create another block at pos-1-0.
24. Move to pos-2-0.
25. Place the block at pos-2-0. (The height at pos-2-0 is now 2)

26. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
27. Create another block at pos-1-0.
28. Move to pos-2-0.
29. Place the block at pos-2-0. (The height at pos-2-0 is now 3)

30. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
31. Create another block at pos-1-0.
32. Move to pos-2-0.
33. Move to pos-3-0.
34. Place the block at pos-3-0. (The height at pos-3-0 is now 1)

35. Move back to pos-2-0.
36. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
37. Create another block at pos-1-0.
38. Move to pos-2-0.
39. Move to pos-3-0.
40. Place the block at pos-3-0. (The height at pos-3-0 is now 2)

41. Move back to pos-2-0.
42. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
43. Create another block at pos-1-0.
44. Move to pos-2-0.
45. Move to pos-3-0.
46. Place the block at pos-3-0. (The height at pos-3-0 is now 3)

Now, the height at pos-1-2, pos-2-0, and pos-3-0 is 3, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end.
