Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-2-2.
4. Move to pos-1-2.
5. Place the block at pos-1-2. (Height at pos-1-2 is now 1)

6. Move back to pos-2-2.
7. Move to pos-2-1.
8. Move to pos-2-0 (depot).
9. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
10. Move to pos-2-1.
11. Move to pos-2-2.
12. Move to pos-1-2.
13. Place the block at pos-1-2. (Height at pos-1-2 is now 2)

14. Move back to pos-2-2.
15. Move to pos-2-1.
16. Move to pos-2-0 (depot).
17. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
18. Move to pos-2-1.
19. Move to pos-2-2.
20. Move to pos-1-2.
21. Place the block at pos-1-2. (Height at pos-1-2 is now 3)

Now, the height at pos-1-2 is 3, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end, which meets the goal.
