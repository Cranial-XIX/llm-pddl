Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-2-2.
4. Move to pos-2-3.
5. Move to pos-1-3.
6. Move to pos-0-3.
7. Place the block at pos-0-3.

Repeat steps 1-7 three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-0-3. 

Please note that the robot must return to the depot (pos-2-0) after each block placement to create a new block. This means after placing the block at pos-0-3, the robot should move back to pos-2-0 following the reverse path.
