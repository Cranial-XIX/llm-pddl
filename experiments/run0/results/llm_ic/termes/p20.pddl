Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0.
2. Move to pos-1-0.
3. Place the block at pos-1-0.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-1-0.
5. Create a block at pos-2-0.
6. Move to pos-1-1.
7. Place the block at pos-1-1.
8. Repeat steps 5-7 once more to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-1-1.
9. Create a block at pos-2-0.
10. Move to pos-0-0.
11. Place the block at pos-0-0.
12. Repeat steps 9-11 three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-0-0.
13. Create a block at pos-2-0.
14. Move to pos-0-2.
15. Place the block at pos-0-2.
16. Repeat steps 13-15 once more to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-0-2.
17. Create a block at pos-2-0.
18. Move to pos-3-0.
19. Place the block at pos-3-0.
20. Repeat steps 17-19 once more to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-3-0.
21. Create a block at pos-2-0.
22. Move to pos-3-2.
23. Place the block at pos-3-2.
24. Repeat steps 21-23 once more to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-3-2.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the specified positions to the desired heights without having an unplaced block at the end.
