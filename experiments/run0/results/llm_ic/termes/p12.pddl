Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-1-0 (the depot).
2. Move to pos-0-0.
3. Place the block at pos-0-0.
4. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
5. Create another block at pos-1-0.
6. Move to pos-0-0.
7. Place the block at pos-0-0. Now the height at pos-0-0 is 2.
8. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
9. Create another block at pos-1-0.
10. Move to pos-0-1.
11. Place the block at pos-0-1.
12. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
13. Create another block at pos-1-0.
14. Move to pos-0-1.
15. Place the block at pos-0-1. Now the height at pos-0-1 is 2.
16. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
17. Create another block at pos-1-0.
18. Move to pos-2-0.
19. Place the block at pos-2-0.
20. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
21. Create another block at pos-1-0.
22. Move to pos-2-0.
23. Place the block at pos-2-0. Now the height at pos-2-0 is 2.
24. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
25. Create another block at pos-1-0.
26. Move to pos-2-1.
27. Place the block at pos-2-1.
28. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
29. Create another block at pos-1-0.
30. Move to pos-2-1.
31. Place the block at pos-2-1.
32. Move back to pos-1-0 (the depot).
33. Create another block at pos-1-0.
34. Move to pos-2-1.
35. Place the block at pos-2-1. Now the height at pos-2-1 is 3.

This plan ensures that all the blocks are placed at the correct positions and heights, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end.
