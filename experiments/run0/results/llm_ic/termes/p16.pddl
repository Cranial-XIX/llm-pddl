Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-1-0.
2. Move to pos-1-1.
3. Move to pos-1-2.
4. Place the block at pos-1-2.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-1-2.

6. Create a block at pos-1-0.
7. Move to pos-2-0.
8. Place the block at pos-2-0.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 one more time to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-2-0.

10. Create a block at pos-1-0.
11. Move to pos-2-0.
12. Move to pos-3-0.
13. Move to pos-3-1.
14. Place the block at pos-3-1.
15. Repeat steps 10-14 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-3-1.

16. Create a block at pos-1-0.
17. Move to pos-2-0.
18. Move to pos-3-0.
19. Move to pos-3-1.
20. Move to pos-3-2.
21. Place the block at pos-3-2.
22. Repeat steps 16-21 three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-3-2.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required heights, and ends without an unplaced block.
