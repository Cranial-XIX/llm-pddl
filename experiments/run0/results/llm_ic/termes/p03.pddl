Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0 (the depot).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-3-1.
4. Place the block at pos-3-1. (The height at pos-3-1 is now 1)

Repeat the above steps three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-3-1. 

So, the full sequence of actions would be:

1. Create block at pos-2-0.
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-3-1.
4. Place block at pos-3-1.
5. Move to pos-2-1.
6. Move to pos-2-0.
7. Create block at pos-2-0.
8. Move to pos-2-1.
9. Move to pos-3-1.
10. Place block at pos-3-1.
11. Move to pos-2-1.
12. Move to pos-2-0.
13. Create block at pos-2-0.
14. Move to pos-2-1.
15. Move to pos-3-1.
16. Place block at pos-3-1.
17. Move to pos-2-1.
18. Move to pos-2-0.
19. Create block at pos-2-0.
20. Move to pos-2-1.
21. Move to pos-3-1.
22. Place block at pos-3-1.

Now, the height at pos-3-1 is 4, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end.
