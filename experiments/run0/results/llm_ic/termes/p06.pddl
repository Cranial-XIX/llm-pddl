Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-2-2.
4. Move to pos-1-2.
5. Place the block at pos-1-2. (height is now 1)

Repeat steps 1-5 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-1-2.

6. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
7. Move to pos-2-1.
8. Move to pos-2-2.
9. Move to pos-3-2.
10. Place the block at pos-3-2. (height is now 1)

Repeat steps 6-10 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-3-2.

This plan ensures that the robot does not end with an unplaced block and achieves the goal of building blocks to the desired height at the specified positions.
