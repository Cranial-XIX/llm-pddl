Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0.
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Place the block at pos-2-1.
4. Move back to pos-2-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times to build the height at pos-2-1 to 3.
6. Once the height at pos-2-1 is 3, move back to pos-2-0.
7. Create a block at pos-2-0.
8. Move to pos-3-0.
9. Place the block at pos-3-0.
10. Move back to pos-2-0.
11. Repeat steps 7-10 two more times to build the height at pos-3-0 to 3.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required height, and ends without an unplaced block.
