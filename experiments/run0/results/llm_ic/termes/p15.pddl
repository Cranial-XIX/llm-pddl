Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
2. Move to pos-2-1.
3. Move to pos-2-2.
4. Move to pos-1-2.
5. Move to pos-0-2.
6. Place the block at pos-0-2.

Repeat steps 1-6 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-0-2.

7. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
8. Move to pos-2-1.
9. Move to pos-2-2.
10. Move to pos-3-2.
11. Place the block at pos-3-2.

Repeat steps 7-11 one more time to reach the desired height of 2 at pos-3-2.

12. Create a block at pos-2-0 (depot).
13. Move to pos-2-1.
14. Move to pos-3-1.
15. Move to pos-3-0.
16. Place the block at pos-3-0.

Repeat steps 12-16 two more times to reach the desired height of 3 at pos-3-0.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required heights, and ends without an unplaced block.
