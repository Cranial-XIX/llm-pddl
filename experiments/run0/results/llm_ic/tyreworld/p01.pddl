Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "open" the boot.
2. "fetch" the wrench from the boot.
3. "fetch" the jack from the boot.
4. "loosen" the nut on the hub using the wrench.
5. "jack-up" the hub using the jack.
6. "undo" the nut on the hub using the wrench.
7. "remove-wheel" the flat tyre from the hub.
8. "put-away" the flat tyre into the boot.
9. "fetch" the intact tyre from the boot.
10. "fetch" the pump from the boot.
11. "inflate" the intact tyre using the pump.
12. "put-away" the pump back into the boot.
13. "put-on-wheel" the inflated tyre onto the hub.
14. "do-up" the nut onto the hub using the wrench.
15. "jack-down" the hub back to the ground.
16. "tighten" the nut on the hub using the wrench.
17. "put-away" the wrench into the boot.
18. "put-away" the jack into the boot.
19. "close" the boot.

This plan ensures that the flat tyre is replaced with an inflated intact tyre on the hub, the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools along with the flat tyre are put back into the boot which is then closed.
