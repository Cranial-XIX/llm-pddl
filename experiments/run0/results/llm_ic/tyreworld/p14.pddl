Given the problem, the optimal plan would be to repeat the process for each of the 14 hubs. Here is the sequence of actions for one hub:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch an intact tyre, the jack, the pump, and the wrench from the boot.
3. Inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
4. Put the pump back in the boot.
5. Use the wrench to loosen the nut on the hub.
6. Use the jack to lift the hub off the ground.
7. Undo the nut on the hub using the wrench.
8. Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
9. Put the flat tyre in the boot.
10. Put the inflated tyre on the hub.
11. Do up the nut on the hub using the wrench.
12. Lower the hub back to the ground using the jack.
13. Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
14. Put the jack and the wrench back in the boot.
15. Close the boot.

Repeat these steps for each of the 14 hubs. This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
