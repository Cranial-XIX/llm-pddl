Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the intact tyre1.
4. Inflate tyre1.
5. Put away the pump.
6. Fetch the wrench.
7. Fetch the jack.
8. Loosen nut1 on hub1.
9. Jack-up hub1.
10. Undo nut1 on hub1.
11. Remove flat tyre1 from hub1.
12. Put away flat tyre1.
13. Put on tyre1 on hub1.
14. Do-up nut1 on hub1.
15. Jack-down hub1.
16. Tighten nut1 on hub1.
17. Repeat steps 3 to 16 for the remaining 12 tyres.
18. Put away the wrench.
19. Put away the jack.
20. Close the boot.

This plan assumes that you can only carry one item at a time and that you need to put away the pump before you can fetch the wrench and the jack. It also assumes that you need to put away the flat tyre before you can put on the new tyre. The plan is optimal in the sense that it minimizes the number of actions needed to achieve the goal.
