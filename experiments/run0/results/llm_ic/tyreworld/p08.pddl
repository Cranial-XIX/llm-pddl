Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the first intact tyre (r1).
4. Inflate r1.
5. Put away the pump.
6. Fetch the wrench and the jack.
7. Loosen the first nut (nuts1).
8. Jack-up the first hub (the-hub1).
9. Undo nuts1.
10. Remove the first flat tyre (w1).
11. Put away w1.
12. Put on wheel r1.
13. Do-up nuts1.
14. Jack-down the-hub1.
15. Tighten nuts1.

Repeat steps 2 to 15 for the remaining 7 tyres (r2 to r8 and w2 to w8, nuts2 to nuts8, the-hub2 to the-hub8).

16. After all tyres have been replaced and inflated, put away the wrench and the jack.
17. Close the boot.

This plan assumes that the agent can only hold one object at a time and that the agent must put away the pump before fetching the wrench and the jack. If the agent can hold multiple objects at the same time, the plan could be optimized further.
