 Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the intact tyre r1, r2, and r3 from the boot.
3. Fetch the pump from the boot.
4. Inflate tyre r1.
5. Inflate tyre r2.
6. Inflate tyre r3.
7. Put the pump back in the boot.
8. Fetch the wrench from the boot.
9. Fetch the jack from the boot.
10. Loosen the nut on hub1.
11. Jack-up hub1.
12. Undo the nut on hub1.
13. Remove the flat tyre w1 from hub1.
14. Put the flat tyre w1 in the boot.
15. Put the inflated tyre r1 on hub1.
16. Do-up the nut on hub1.
17. Jack-down hub1.
18. Tighten the nut on hub1.
19. Loosen the nut on hub2.
20. Jack-up hub2.
21. Undo the nut on hub2.
22. Remove the flat tyre w2 from hub2.
23. Put the flat tyre w2 in the boot.
24. Put the inflated tyre r2 on hub2.
25. Do-up the nut on hub2.
26. Jack-down hub2.
27. Tighten the nut on hub2.
28. Loosen the nut on hub3.
29. Jack-up hub3.
30. Undo the nut on hub3.
31. Remove the flat tyre w3 from hub3.
32. Put the flat tyre w3 in the boot.
33. Put the inflated tyre r3 on hub3.
34. Do-up the nut on hub3.
35. Jack-down hub3.
36. Tighten the nut on hub3.
37. Put the jack back in the boot.
38. Put the wrench back in the boot.
39. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated tyres, all the nuts are tightened on the hubs, and all the tools along with the flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
