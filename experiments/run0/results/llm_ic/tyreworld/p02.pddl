Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the intact tyre1.
4. Inflate tyre1.
5. Put away the pump.
6. Fetch the wrench.
7. Fetch the jack.
8. Loosen nut1 on hub1.
9. Jack-up hub1.
10. Undo nut1.
11. Remove flat tyre1 from hub1.
12. Put away flat tyre1.
13. Put on tyre1 onto hub1.
14. Do-up nut1.
15. Jack-down hub1.
16. Tighten nut1.
17. Repeat steps 2 to 16 for the remaining 8 tyres.
18. Put away the wrench.
19. Put away the jack.
20. Close the boot.

This plan assumes that the agent can only hold one item at a time and that the agent must put away the pump before fetching the wrench and jack. If the agent can hold multiple items at once, the plan could be optimized further.
