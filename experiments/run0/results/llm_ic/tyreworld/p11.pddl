Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the intact tyre1.
4. Inflate tyre1.
5. Put away the pump.
6. Fetch the wrench.
7. Fetch the jack.
8. Loosen nut1 on hub1.
9. Jack-up hub1.
10. Undo nut1 on hub1.
11. Remove flat tyre1 from hub1.
12. Put away flat tyre1.
13. Put on tyre1 onto hub1.
14. Do-up nut1 on hub1.
15. Jack-down hub1.
16. Tighten nut1 on hub1.
17. Repeat steps 3 to 16 for the remaining 10 tyres.
18. Put away the wrench.
19. Put away the jack.
20. Close the boot.

This plan assumes that you can only carry one item at a time and that you put away items when you're done with them to keep the workspace tidy. It also assumes that you inflate each tyre immediately after fetching it from the boot, to ensure that all tyres are inflated before they are put on the hubs.
