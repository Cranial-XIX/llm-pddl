Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the intact tyres one by one and inflate each of them using the pump. Repeat this step 17 times.
4. Put the pump back in the boot.
5. Fetch the wrench and the jack.
6. For each of the 17 hubs, do the following:
   1. Loosen the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   2. Jack up the hub using the jack.
   3. Undo the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   4. Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   5. Put the flat tyre in the boot.
   6. Fetch an inflated intact tyre.
   7. Put the intact tyre on the hub.
   8. Do up the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   9. Jack down the hub.
   10. Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
7. Put the wrench and the jack back in the boot.
8. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
