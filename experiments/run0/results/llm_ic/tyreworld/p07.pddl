Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the first intact tyre (r1) from the boot and inflate it.
4. Fetch the second intact tyre (r2) from the boot and inflate it.
5. Continue this process until all 7 intact tyres (r3, r4, r5, r6, r7) are inflated.
6. Put the pump back in the boot.
7. Fetch the wrench and the jack from the boot.
8. Loosen the nut on the first hub (nuts1) using the wrench.
9. Use the jack to lift the first hub (the-hub1) off the ground.
10. Undo the nut (nuts1) from the first hub (the-hub1).
11. Remove the flat tyre (w1) from the first hub (the-hub1).
12. Put the flat tyre (w1) in the boot.
13. Put the first inflated tyre (r1) on the first hub (the-hub1).
14. Fasten the nut (nuts1) on the first hub (the-hub1).
15. Lower the first hub (the-hub1) back to the ground using the jack.
16. Tighten the nut (nuts1) on the first hub (the-hub1).
17. Repeat steps 8-16 for the remaining 6 hubs (the-hub2, the-hub3, the-hub4, the-hub5, the-hub6, the-hub7) and their corresponding nuts and tyres.
18. Once all the flat tyres have been replaced and the intact tyres have been inflated and put on the hubs, put the wrench and the jack back in the boot.
19. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
