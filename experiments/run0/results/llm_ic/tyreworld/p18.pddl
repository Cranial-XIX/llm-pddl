Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch all 18 intact tyres (r1 to r18) one by one and inflate each of them using the pump. After inflating each tyre, put it back into the boot.
4. Put away the pump.
5. Fetch the wrench and the jack.
6. For each hub (from hub1 to hub18), perform the following steps:
   - Loosen the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Jack up the hub using the jack.
   - Undo the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   - Put away the flat tyre into the boot.
   - Fetch an inflated tyre from the boot.
   - Put the inflated tyre onto the hub.
   - Do up the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Jack down the hub using the jack.
   - Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
7. Put away the jack and the wrench into the boot.
8. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated tyres on the hubs, all nuts are tight on the hubs, and all tools and replaced tyres are put back into the boot which is then closed.
