Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch all 16 intact tyres (r1 to r16) and inflate them one by one using the pump.
4. Put the pump back in the boot.
5. Fetch the wrench and the jack.
6. For each hub (from hub1 to hub16), perform the following steps:
   - Loosen the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Jack up the hub using the jack.
   - Undo the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   - Put the flat tyre in the boot.
   - Fetch the corresponding inflated tyre (from r1 to r16).
   - Put the inflated tyre on the hub.
   - Do up the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   - Jack down the hub using the jack.
   - Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
7. Put the wrench and the jack back in the boot.
8. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated tyres on the hubs, all nuts are tight on the hubs, and all tools and replaced tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
