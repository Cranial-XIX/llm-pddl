Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the first intact tyre (r1).
4. Inflate r1.
5. Fetch the second intact tyre (r2).
6. Inflate r2.
7. Fetch the third intact tyre (r3).
8. Inflate r3.
9. Fetch the fourth intact tyre (r4).
10. Inflate r4.
11. Put away the pump.
12. Fetch the wrench.
13. Fetch the jack.
14. Loosen the first nut (nuts1).
15. Jack-up the first hub (the-hub1).
16. Undo nuts1.
17. Remove the first flat tyre (w1).
18. Put away w1.
19. Put on wheel r1.
20. Do-up nuts1.
21. Jack-down the-hub1.
22. Tighten nuts1.
23. Loosen the second nut (nuts2).
24. Jack-up the second hub (the-hub2).
25. Undo nuts2.
26. Remove the second flat tyre (w2).
27. Put away w2.
28. Put on wheel r2.
29. Do-up nuts2.
30. Jack-down the-hub2.
31. Tighten nuts2.
32. Loosen the third nut (nuts3).
33. Jack-up the third hub (the-hub3).
34. Undo nuts3.
35. Remove the third flat tyre (w3).
36. Put away w3.
37. Put on wheel r3.
38. Do-up nuts3.
39. Jack-down the-hub3.
40. Tighten nuts3.
41. Loosen the fourth nut (nuts4).
42. Jack-up the fourth hub (the-hub4).
43. Undo nuts4.
44. Remove the fourth flat tyre (w4).
45. Put away w4.
46. Put on wheel r4.
47. Do-up nuts4.
48. Jack-down the-hub4.
49. Tighten nuts4.
50. Put away the jack.
51. Put away the wrench.
52. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
