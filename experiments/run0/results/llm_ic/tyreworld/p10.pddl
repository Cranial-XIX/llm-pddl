Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Open the boot.
2. Fetch the pump.
3. Fetch the intact tyres one by one and inflate them using the pump, then put them back into the boot.
4. Fetch the wrench and the jack.
5. For each hub, do the following:
   1. Use the wrench to loosen the nut on the hub.
   2. Use the jack to jack-up the hub.
   3. Undo the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   4. Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   5. Put the flat tyre into the boot.
   6. Fetch an inflated tyre from the boot.
   7. Put the inflated tyre onto the hub.
   8. Do-up the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   9. Use the jack to jack-down the hub.
   10. Use the wrench to tighten the nut on the hub.
6. Put the wrench and the jack back into the boot.
7. Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back into the boot, which is then closed.
