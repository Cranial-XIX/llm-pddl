Sure, here is a sequence of actions to make the 8 cocktails:

1. Grasp the shot glass 1.
2. Fill shot glass 1 with ingredient2 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp the shaker with the other hand.
4. Pour ingredient2 from shot glass 1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave shot glass 1 on the table.
6. Grasp shot glass 1 again.
7. Fill shot glass 1 with ingredient3 from the dispenser.
8. Pour ingredient3 from shot glass 1 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to shot glass 1.
11. Leave shot glass 1 on the table.
12. Empty the shaker.
13. Clean the shaker.
14. Repeat steps 1-13 for shot glasses 2-8, replacing the ingredients as needed for each cocktail.

For shot glass 2, use ingredient1 and ingredient2.
For shot glass 3, use ingredient1 and ingredient2.
For shot glass 4, use ingredient2 and ingredient1.
For shot glass 5, use ingredient2 and ingredient1.
For shot glass 6, use ingredient3 and ingredient1.
For shot glass 7, use ingredient2 and ingredient3.
For shot glass 8, use ingredient2 and ingredient1.

This plan assumes that the dispensers for the ingredients are always available and that the shaker can be cleaned quickly. It also assumes that the robot can perform these actions in a relatively short amount of time.
