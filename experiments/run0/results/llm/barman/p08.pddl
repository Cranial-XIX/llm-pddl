Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Grasp the shot1 glass with your left hand.
2. Fill the shot1 glass with ingredient3 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour ingredient3 from shot1 glass to the clean shaker.
5. Leave the shot1 glass on the table.
6. Fill the shot1 glass with ingredient2 from the dispenser.
7. Pour ingredient2 from shot1 glass to the used shaker.
8. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
9. Pour from the shaker to the shot1 glass.
10. Leave the shaker on the table.
11. Leave the shot1 glass on the table.

Repeat the same steps for shot2, shot3, and shot4, replacing ingredient3 and ingredient2 with the appropriate ingredients for each cocktail. Remember to clean the shaker and shot glasses before making a new cocktail. 

For shot2, use ingredient1 and ingredient3.
For shot3, use ingredient2 and ingredient1.
For shot4, use ingredient2 and ingredient3.

This plan assumes that the shaker and shot glasses are cleaned automatically or by another process not included in the steps. If you need to clean them manually, add the steps to clean the shaker and shot glasses after pouring the cocktail and before starting a new one.
