Sure, here is an optimal plan to make the 5 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot1 with your left hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour ingredient1 from shot1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave shot1 on the table.
6. Grasp shot1 with your left hand.
7. Fill shot1 with ingredient3.
8. Pour ingredient3 from shot1 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to shot1.
11. Leave the shaker on the table.
12. Clean the shaker.

Repeat steps 1-12 for shot2, shot3, shot4, and shot5, replacing ingredient1 and ingredient3 with the appropriate ingredients for each cocktail. For shot2, use ingredient1 and ingredient2. For shot3, shot4, and shot5, use ingredient3 and ingredient1. 

This plan assumes that the shaker can hold enough of each ingredient to make one cocktail at a time, and that there is enough of each ingredient to make all 5 cocktails.
