Sure, here is an optimal plan to make the 3 cocktails:

1. Grasp the shot glass 1 with your left hand.
2. Fill the shot glass 1 with ingredient3 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour ingredient3 from shot glass 1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave the shot glass 1 on the table.
6. Grasp the shot glass 1 with your left hand again.
7. Fill the shot glass 1 with ingredient1 from the dispenser.
8. Pour ingredient1 from shot glass 1 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to the shot glass 1.
11. Leave the shot glass 1 on the table.
12. Empty the shaker.
13. Clean the shaker.

Repeat the above steps for shot glass 2 and shot glass 3, replacing ingredient1 with ingredient2 for shot glass 3. This will result in shot glass 1 containing cocktail1, shot glass 2 containing cocktail3, and shot glass 3 containing cocktail2.
