Sure, here is a sequence of actions to make the 7 cocktails:

1. Grasp the shaker with your left hand.
2. Grasp shot1 with your right hand.
3. Fill shot1 with ingredient3.
4. Pour ingredient3 from shot1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave shot1 on the table.
6. Grasp shot7 with your right hand.
7. Fill shot7 with ingredient1.
8. Pour ingredient1 from shot7 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to shot1.
11. Empty the shaker.
12. Clean the shaker.
13. Repeat steps 2-12 for shot2, shot3, shot4, shot5, and shot6, replacing ingredient3 and ingredient1 with the appropriate ingredients for each cocktail.
14. For shot7, after pouring ingredient1 into the shaker, leave shot7 on the table and grasp a clean shot glass with your right hand. Fill the new shot glass with ingredient2 and pour it into the shaker. Then shake the cocktail in the shaker and pour it into shot7.

This plan assumes that the shaker can hold two ingredients at a time and that each shot glass can hold one ingredient or one cocktail. It also assumes that the shaker and shot glasses can be cleaned quickly and efficiently.
