Sure, here is an optimal plan to make the 4 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot glass 1 (shot1) with your left hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient1 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour ingredient1 from shot1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave shot1 on the table.
6. Grasp shot1 with your left hand.
7. Fill shot1 with ingredient2 from the dispenser.
8. Pour ingredient2 from shot1 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to shot1. (Now shot1 contains cocktail4)
11. Leave the shaker on the table.
12. Leave shot1 on the table.

Repeat the same steps for shot2, shot3, and shot4 but replace ingredient1 and ingredient2 with the correct ingredients for each cocktail:

For shot2 (cocktail1): ingredient2 and ingredient1
For shot3 (cocktail2): ingredient2 and ingredient3
For shot4 (cocktail3): ingredient2 and ingredient1

Remember to clean the shaker and shot glasses before making a new cocktail.
