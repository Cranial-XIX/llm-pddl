Sure, here is an optimal plan to make the 3 cocktails:

1. Grasp the shot glass 1 with your left hand.
2. Fill the shot glass 1 with ingredient2 from the dispenser.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour the ingredient from shot glass 1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave the shot glass 1 on the table.
6. Grasp the shot glass 1 with your left hand again.
7. Fill the shot glass 1 with ingredient3 from the dispenser.
8. Pour the ingredient from shot glass 1 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to the shot glass 1. Now shot glass 1 contains cocktail2.
11. Leave the shaker on the table.
12. Empty the shot glass 1.
13. Clean the shot glass 1.

Repeat the steps 1-13 for shot glass 2 and shot glass 3, replacing ingredient2 with ingredient1 for shot glass 2 to make cocktail1, and replacing ingredient2 with ingredient1 and ingredient3 with ingredient2 for shot glass 3 to make cocktail3. 

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned after each cocktail is made. If the shaker does not need to be cleaned between cocktails, steps 11-13 can be omitted for the first and second cocktails.
