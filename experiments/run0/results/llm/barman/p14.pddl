Sure, here is a sequence of actions to make the 7 cocktails:

1. Grasp shot glass 1 (shot1) with your left hand.
2. Fill shot1 with ingredient2.
3. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
4. Pour ingredient2 from shot1 to the clean shaker.
5. Leave shot1 on the table.
6. Grasp shot glass 2 (shot2) with your left hand.
7. Fill shot2 with ingredient3.
8. Pour ingredient3 from shot2 to the used shaker.
9. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
10. Pour from the shaker to shot1.
11. Leave the shaker on the table.
12. Clean shot2.
13. Repeat steps 1-12 for cocktails 1, 4, 6, 2, and 5, replacing shot1 with the appropriate shot glass for each cocktail.
14. For the final cocktail, grasp shot glass 7 (shot7) with your left hand.
15. Fill shot7 with ingredient2.
16. Grasp the shaker with your right hand.
17. Pour ingredient2 from shot7 to the clean shaker.
18. Leave shot7 on the table.
19. Grasp shot glass 8 (shot8) with your left hand.
20. Fill shot8 with ingredient1.
21. Pour ingredient1 from shot8 to the used shaker.
22. Shake the cocktail in the shaker.
23. Pour from the shaker to shot7.
24. Leave the shaker on the table.
25. Clean shot8.

This plan assumes that the shaker is cleaned between each cocktail, and that each shot glass is cleaned after it is used. It also assumes that the shaker has enough capacity to hold the ingredients for each cocktail.
