Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move to pos-1-0.
3. Place the block at pos-1-0.
4. Move back to pos-2-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 three more times to build the block at pos-1-0 to a height of 4.
6. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
7. Move to pos-1-1.
8. Place the block at pos-1-1.
9. Move back to pos-2-0.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 once more to build the block at pos-1-1 to a height of 2.
11. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
12. Move to pos-0-0.
13. Place the block at pos-0-0.
14. Move back to pos-2-0.
15. Repeat steps 11-14 three more times to build the block at pos-0-0 to a height of 4.
16. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
17. Move to pos-0-2.
18. Place the block at pos-0-2.
19. Move back to pos-2-0.
20. Repeat steps 16-19 once more to build the block at pos-0-2 to a height of 2.
21. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
22. Move to pos-3-0.
23. Place the block at pos-3-0.
24. Move back to pos-2-0.
25. Repeat steps 21-24 once more to build the block at pos-3-0 to a height of 2.
26. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
27. Move to pos-3-2.
28. Place the block at pos-3-2.
29. Move back to pos-2-0.
30. Repeat steps 26-29 once more to build the block at pos-3-2 to a height of 2.

This plan ensures that all the blocks are placed at the correct positions and heights, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end.
