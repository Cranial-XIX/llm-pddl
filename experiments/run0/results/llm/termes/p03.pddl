Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robot to build blocks so that the height at pos-3-1 is 4:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
3. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-3-1.
4. Place a block at pos-3-1.
5. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-0.
6. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 three more times.

This sequence of behaviors will result in the robot building a stack of 4 blocks at pos-3-1, which is the goal. The robot will not have an unplaced block at the end, as it only creates a block when it is ready to place it.
