Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
3. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-2.
4. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-1-2.
5. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-0-2.
6. Place the block at pos-0-2. (Height at pos-0-2 is now 1)
7. Repeat steps 1-6 four more times. (Height at pos-0-2 is now 5)

Now, let's build the blocks at pos-3-0 and pos-3-2.

8. Move from pos-0-2 to pos-1-2.
9. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-2-2.
10. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-3-2.
11. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-2).
12. Place the block at pos-3-2. (Height at pos-3-2 is now 1)
13. Repeat steps 11-12 one more time. (Height at pos-3-2 is now 2)

14. Move from pos-3-2 to pos-3-1.
15. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-0.
16. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
17. Place the block at pos-3-0. (Height at pos-3-0 is now 1)
18. Repeat steps 16-17 two more times. (Height at pos-3-0 is now 3)

This plan ensures that the height at pos-0-2 is 5, the height at pos-3-0 is 3, and the height at pos-3-2 is 2, as required.
