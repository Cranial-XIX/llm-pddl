Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
3. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-2.
4. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-2-3.
5. Place the block at pos-2-3.
6. Move from pos-2-3 to pos-2-2.
7. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-2-1.
8. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
9. Repeat steps 1-8 three more times to build the height at pos-2-3 to 4.
10. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
11. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
12. Place the block at pos-3-0.
13. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
14. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
15. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
16. Place the block at pos-3-0.

This plan will result in a height of 4 at pos-2-3 and a height of 2 at pos-3-0, as required.
