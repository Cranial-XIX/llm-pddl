Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robot to build blocks so that the height at pos-0-3 is 4:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
3. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-2.
4. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-2-3.
5. Move from pos-2-3 to pos-1-3.
6. Move from pos-1-3 to pos-0-3.
7. Place the block at pos-0-3.

Repeat steps 1-7 three more times to reach the desired height of 4 at pos-0-3. 

Remember, after the final block is placed at pos-0-3, the robot should not have any unplaced blocks.
