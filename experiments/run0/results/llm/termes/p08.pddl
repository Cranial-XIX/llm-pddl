Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-0-2.
3. Place the block at pos-0-2.
4. Move from pos-0-2 to pos-2-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 two more times to build the height at pos-0-2 to 3.
6. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
7. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-1.
8. Place the block at pos-1-1.
9. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-2-0.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 two more times to build the height at pos-1-1 to 3.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required height, and ends up without an unplaced block.
