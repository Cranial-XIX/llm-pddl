Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
3. Place a block at pos-2-1.
4. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
5. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
6. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
7. Place a block at pos-2-1.
8. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
9. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
10. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
11. Place a block at pos-2-1.
12. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-0.
13. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
14. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
15. Place a block at pos-3-0.
16. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
17. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
18. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
19. Place a block at pos-3-0.
20. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
21. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
22. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
23. Place a block at pos-3-0.

This plan ensures that the height at pos-2-1 and pos-3-0 is 3, and the robot does not have an unplaced block at the end.
