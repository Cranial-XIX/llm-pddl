Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
2. Move to pos-2-0.
3. Place the block at pos-2-0.
4. Move back to the depot (pos-1-0).
5. Repeat steps 1-4 three more times. Now the height at pos-2-0 is 4.
6. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
7. Move to pos-3-0.
8. Place the block at pos-3-0.
9. Move back to the depot (pos-1-0).
10. Repeat steps 6-9 two more times. Now the height at pos-3-0 is 3.
11. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
12. Move to pos-3-1.
13. Place the block at pos-3-1.
14. Move back to the depot (pos-1-0).
15. Repeat steps 11-14 two more times. Now the height at pos-3-1 is 3.
16. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
17. Move to pos-3-2.
18. Place the block at pos-3-2.
19. Move back to the depot (pos-1-0).
20. Repeat steps 16-19 three more times. Now the height at pos-3-2 is 4.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required heights, and ends up without an unplaced block.
