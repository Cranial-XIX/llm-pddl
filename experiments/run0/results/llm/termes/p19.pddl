Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
2. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-1-0.
3. Place a block at pos-1-0.
4. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-3-0.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 three more times to make the height at pos-1-0 equal to 4.
6. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
7. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-1-1.
8. Place a block at pos-1-1.
9. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-3-0.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 three more times to make the height at pos-1-1 equal to 4.
11. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
12. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-1-2.
13. Place a block at pos-1-2.
14. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-3-0.
15. Repeat steps 11-14 one more time to make the height at pos-1-2 equal to 2.
16. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
17. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
18. Place a block at pos-2-0.
19. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
20. Repeat steps 16-19 one more time to make the height at pos-2-0 equal to 2.
21. Create a block at the depot (pos-3-0).
22. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-2.
23. Place a block at pos-2-2.
24. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-3-0.
25. Repeat steps 21-24 one more time to make the height at pos-2-2 equal to 2.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required heights, and ends up at the depot without an unplaced block.
