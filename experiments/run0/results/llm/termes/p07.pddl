Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robot to build blocks so that the height at pos-0-3 is 3:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
3. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-0-0.
4. Move from pos-0-0 to pos-0-1.
5. Move from pos-0-1 to pos-0-2.
6. Move from pos-0-2 to pos-0-3.
7. Place the block at pos-0-3.

Repeat steps 1-7 two more times to reach the desired height of 3 at pos-0-3. 

Remember, after placing the third block at pos-0-3, the robot should return to the depot (pos-2-0) without carrying any block to meet the condition of not having an unplaced block at the end.
