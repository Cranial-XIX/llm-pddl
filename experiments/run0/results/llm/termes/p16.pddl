Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
2. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-1-1.
3. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-1-2.
4. Place a block at pos-1-2.
5. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-1-1.
6. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-1-0.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 four more times to build the height at pos-1-2 to 5.

8. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
9. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
10. Place a block at pos-2-0.
11. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
12. Repeat steps 8-11 one more time to build the height at pos-2-0 to 2.

13. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
14. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
15. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
16. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-3-1.
17. Place a block at pos-3-1.
18. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-0.
19. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
20. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
21. Repeat steps 13-20 four more times to build the height at pos-3-1 to 5.

22. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
23. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
24. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
25. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-3-1.
26. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-2.
27. Place a block at pos-3-2.
28. Move from pos-3-2 to pos-3-1.
29. Move from pos-3-1 to pos-3-0.
30. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
31. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
32. Repeat steps 22-31 three more times to build the height at pos-3-2 to 4.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks to the required heights at the specified positions and does not have an unplaced block at the end.
