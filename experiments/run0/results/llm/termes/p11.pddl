Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
2. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-1-1.
3. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-1-2.
4. Place a block at pos-1-2.
5. Move from pos-1-2 to pos-1-1.
6. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-1-0.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 two more times to build the height at pos-1-2 to 3.
8. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
9. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
10. Place a block at pos-2-0.
11. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
12. Repeat steps 8-11 two more times to build the height at pos-2-0 to 3.
13. Create a block at the depot (pos-1-0).
14. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-2-0.
15. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-3-0.
16. Place a block at pos-3-0.
17. Move from pos-3-0 to pos-2-0.
18. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0.
19. Repeat steps 13-18 two more times to build the height at pos-3-0 to 3.

This plan ensures that the robot builds the blocks at the required positions to the required height of 3, and ends up at the depot without an unplaced block.
