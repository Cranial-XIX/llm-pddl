Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot. (The robot is at pos-2-0 and now has a block)
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-1-0. (The robot is at pos-1-0 and has a block)
3. Move from pos-1-0 to pos-1-1. (The robot is at pos-1-1 and has a block)
4. Move from pos-1-1 to pos-1-2. (The robot is at pos-1-2 and has a block)
5. Place a block at pos-1-2. (The robot is at pos-1-2 and does not have a block)

Repeat steps 1-5 two more times to reach the desired height of 3 at pos-1-2. 

Please note that the robot ends up at pos-1-2 without a block, which satisfies the condition of not having an unplaced block at the end.
