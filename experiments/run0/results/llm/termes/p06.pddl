Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
2. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
3. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-2.
4. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-1-2.
5. Place a block at pos-1-2.
6. Repeat steps 1-5 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-1-2.

Now, to build the block at pos-3-2:

7. Create a block at the depot (pos-2-0).
8. Move from pos-2-0 to pos-2-1.
9. Move from pos-2-1 to pos-2-2.
10. Move from pos-2-2 to pos-3-2.
11. Place a block at pos-3-2.
12. Repeat steps 7-11 four more times to reach the desired height of 5 at pos-3-2.

This plan ensures that the robot does not end with an unplaced block, as it only creates a block when it is ready to place it.
