Sure, here is an optimal plan to move all crates to depot48:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
3. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
4. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 to depot48-2-2.
5. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
7. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
8. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 to depot48-2-3.
9. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
10. "lift" action: Lift crate2 from container-0-2 using hoist0.
11. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate2 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
12. "drop" action: Drop crate2 from hoist0 to depot48-2-1.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas in depot48.
