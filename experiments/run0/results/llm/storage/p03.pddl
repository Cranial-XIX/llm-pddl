Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
   Parameters: hoist0, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea
2. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-0 to loadarea.
   Parameters: hoist0, container-0-0, loadarea
3. "move" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
   Parameters: hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-2
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 onto depot48-1-2.
   Parameters: hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48

This plan assumes that the hoist can carry the crate while moving between areas. If this is not the case, additional steps may be needed to move the hoist and crate separately.
