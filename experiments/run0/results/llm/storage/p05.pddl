Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
3. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
4. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1.
5. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
7. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
8. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-2.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the available hoists. The hoists are moved out of the depot to the loadarea, lift the crates, then go back into the depot to drop the crates. This plan is optimal as it minimizes the number of actions required to achieve the goal.
