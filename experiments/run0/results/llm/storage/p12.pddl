Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is in depot48-1-1 and depot48-1-1 and loadarea are connected.

2. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is in the loadarea, loadarea and container-0-0 are connected, and container-0-0 is clear.

3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is available, hoist0 is at container-0-0, crate0 is on the surface in container-0-0, and container-0-0 is in container0.

4. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is in container-0-0 and container-0-0 and loadarea are connected.

5. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-1-1. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is in the loadarea, loadarea and depot48-1-1 are connected, and depot48-1-1 is clear.

6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-1-1. The preconditions are met as hoist0 is at depot48-1-1, hoist0 is lifting crate0, depot48-1-1 is clear, and depot48-1-1 is in depot48.

This sequence of actions will move the crate from the container store area to the depot, achieving the goal.
