Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: hoist0 goes out from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
3. "go-in" action: hoist0 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 to depot48-2-1.
5. "go-out" action: hoist0 goes out from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate1 from container-0-1.
7. "go-in" action: hoist0 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
8. "move" action: hoist0 moves from depot48-2-1 to depot48-2-2.
9. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate1 to depot48-2-2.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved to depot48 in the most efficient way possible.
