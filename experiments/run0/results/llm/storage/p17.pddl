Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: hoist1 goes out from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: hoist1 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
3. "go-in" action: hoist1 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
4. "drop" action: hoist1 drops crate0 in depot48-2-1.

5. "go-out" action: hoist2 goes out from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: hoist2 lifts crate1 from container-0-1.
7. "go-in" action: hoist2 goes in from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
8. "drop" action: hoist2 drops crate1 in depot48-1-2.

This plan assumes that the hoists can move between the depot and the loadarea, and that the loadarea is connected to the container storeareas. The plan also assumes that the hoists can lift and drop the crates, and that the depot storeareas are clear and ready to receive the crates.
