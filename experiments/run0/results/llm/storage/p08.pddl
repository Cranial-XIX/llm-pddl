Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
3. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
4. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-3.
5. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
7. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
8. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-2.
9. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
10. "lift" action: Lift crate2 from container-0-2 using hoist0.
11. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate2 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
12. "drop" action: Drop crate2 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the available hoists. The hoists are moved out of the depot to the loadarea, lift a crate, then go back into the depot to drop the crate. This process is repeated until all crates are in the depot.
