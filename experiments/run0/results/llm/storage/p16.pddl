Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
2. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-0 to loadarea.
3. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 onto depot48-2-2.

Now, we repeat the process for the second crate:

5. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
6. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to container-0-1.
7. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate1 from container-0-1.
8. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-1 to loadarea.
9. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
10. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate1 onto depot48-2-1.

This plan ensures that both crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas in the most efficient way possible.
