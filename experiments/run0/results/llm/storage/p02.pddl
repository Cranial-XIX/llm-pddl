Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
   Parameters: hoist0, crate0, container-0-0
2. "go-out" action: hoist0 moves from container-0-0 to loadarea.
   Parameters: hoist0, container-0-0, loadarea
3. "go-in" action: hoist0 moves from loadarea to depot48-1-1.
   Parameters: hoist0, loadarea, depot48-1-1
4. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate0 onto depot48-1-1.
   Parameters: hoist0, crate0, depot48-1-1

This plan assumes that the hoist can carry the crate through the transit area (loadarea). The hoist first lifts the crate from its current location, then moves out to the transit area, then goes into the destination store area, and finally drops the crate at the destination.
