Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea. 
2. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
4. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from container-0-0 to loadarea.
5. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 to depot48-2-1.
7. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
8. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-1.
9. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
10. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from container-0-1 to loadarea.
11. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
12. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 to depot48-2-2.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the available hoist.
