Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist1 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea. The preconditions are met as hoist1 is in depot48-1-1 and depot48-1-1 is connected to loadarea.

2. "lift" action: Lift crate0 using hoist1 from container-0-0 to loadarea. The preconditions are met as hoist1 is available, hoist1 is at loadarea, crate0 is on the surface in container-0-0, and container-0-0 is in container0.

3. "go-in" action: Move hoist1 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-1-1. The preconditions are met as hoist1 is in loadarea, loadarea and depot48-1-1 are connected, and depot48-1-1 is clear.

4. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist1 onto depot48-1-1. The preconditions are met as hoist1 is at depot48-1-1, hoist1 is lifting crate0, depot48-1-1 is clear, and depot48-1-1 is in depot48.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved to depot48, which is the goal of the problem.
