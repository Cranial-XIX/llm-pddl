Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: hoist2 goes out from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: hoist2 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
3. "go-in" action: hoist2 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
4. "drop" action: hoist2 drops crate0 at depot48-2-2.

5. "go-out" action: hoist1 goes out from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: hoist1 lifts crate1 from container-0-1.
7. "go-in" action: hoist1 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
8. "drop" action: hoist1 drops crate1 at depot48-2-1.

9. "go-out" action: hoist0 goes out from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
10. "lift" action: hoist0 lifts crate2 from container-0-2.
11. "go-in" action: hoist0 goes in from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
12. "drop" action: hoist0 drops crate2 at depot48-2-3.

This plan assumes that the hoists can move between the depot storeareas and the loadarea without any restrictions. If there are any restrictions, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
