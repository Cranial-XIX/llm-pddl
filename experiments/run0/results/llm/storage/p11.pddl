Sure, here is an optimal plan to move all crates to depot48:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
2. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
3. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
4. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1.
5. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
6. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
7. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
8. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-2.
9. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
10. "lift" action: Lift crate2 from container-0-2 using hoist0.
11. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate2 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
12. "drop" action: Drop crate2 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-3.
13. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
14. "lift" action: Lift crate3 from container-0-3 using hoist0.
15. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate3 from loadarea to depot48-2-4.
16. "drop" action: Drop crate3 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-4.

This plan assumes that the hoists can carry one crate at a time and that the hoists can move between any connected areas. The plan also assumes that the hoists can move while carrying a crate. The plan moves the crates one by one from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the hoist. The hoist first goes out to the loadarea, lifts a crate, goes into the depot, and drops the crate. This process is repeated until all crates are moved to the depot.
