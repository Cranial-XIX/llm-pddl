Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Use hoist0 to "go-out" from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
2. Use hoist0 to "go-in" from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. Use hoist0 to "lift" crate0 from container-0-0.
4. Use hoist0 to "go-out" from container-0-0 to loadarea.
5. Use hoist0 to "go-in" from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
6. Use hoist0 to "drop" crate0 at depot48-2-1.

Repeat the above steps for the remaining crates:

7. Use hoist1 to "go-out" from depot48-1-2 to loadarea.
8. Use hoist1 to "go-in" from loadarea to container-0-1.
9. Use hoist1 to "lift" crate1 from container-0-1.
10. Use hoist1 to "go-out" from container-0-1 to loadarea.
11. Use hoist1 to "go-in" from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
12. Use hoist1 to "drop" crate1 at depot48-1-2.

13. Use hoist2 to "go-out" from depot48-1-3 to loadarea.
14. Use hoist2 to "go-in" from loadarea to container-0-2.
15. Use hoist2 to "lift" crate2 from container-0-2.
16. Use hoist2 to "go-out" from container-0-2 to loadarea.
17. Use hoist2 to "go-in" from loadarea to depot48-1-3.
18. Use hoist2 to "drop" crate2 at depot48-1-3.

For the last crate:

19. Use hoist0 to "go-out" from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
20. Use hoist0 to "go-in" from loadarea to container-0-3.
21. Use hoist0 to "lift" crate3 from container-0-3.
22. Use hoist0 to "go-out" from container-0-3 to loadarea.
23. Use hoist0 to "go-in" from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
24. Use hoist0 to "drop" crate3 at depot48-2-1.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas using the available hoists.
