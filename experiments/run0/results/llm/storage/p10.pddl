Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea.
2. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0.
3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0.
4. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea.
5. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1.
6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1.

Repeat the above steps for the remaining crates:

7. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-1 to loadarea.
8. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-1.
9. "lift" action: Lift crate1 from container-0-1 using hoist0.
10. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate1 from container-0-1 to loadarea.
11. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate1 from loadarea to depot48-2-2.
12. "drop" action: Drop crate1 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-2.

13. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-2 to loadarea.
14. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-2.
15. "lift" action: Lift crate2 from container-0-2 using hoist0.
16. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate2 from container-0-2 to loadarea.
17. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate2 from loadarea to depot48-2-3.
18. "drop" action: Drop crate2 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-3.

19. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-2-3 to loadarea.
20. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-3.
21. "lift" action: Lift crate3 from container-0-3 using hoist0.
22. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate3 from container-0-3 to loadarea.
23. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate3 from loadarea to depot48-2-4.
24. "drop" action: Drop crate3 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-4.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved from the container storeareas to the depot storeareas in an optimal way.
