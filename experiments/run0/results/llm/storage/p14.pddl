Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "lift" action: hoist2 lifts crate0 from container-0-0.
   Parameters: hoist2, crate0, container-0-0, loadarea
2. "go-out" action: hoist2 moves from container-0-0 to loadarea.
   Parameters: hoist2, container-0-0, loadarea
3. "move" action: hoist2 moves from loadarea to depot48-1-2.
   Parameters: hoist2, loadarea, depot48-1-2
4. "drop" action: hoist2 drops crate0 onto depot48-1-2.
   Parameters: hoist2, crate0, depot48-1-2, depot48

This plan assumes that the hoists can move while lifting a crate, and that the hoists can move between any connected areas. The plan moves the crate from the container store area to the depot using the hoist that is already in the connected depot store area, minimizing the number of moves.
