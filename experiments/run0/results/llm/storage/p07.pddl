Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-3 to loadarea. (hoist0 is now in loadarea)
2. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0. (hoist0 is now in container-0-0)
3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0. (hoist0 is now lifting crate0)
4. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from container-0-0 to loadarea. (hoist0 is now in loadarea)
5. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to depot48-2-1. (hoist0 is now in depot48-2-1)
6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-2-1. (crate0 is now in depot48-2-1)
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for crate1 and crate2, but drop them in depot48-2-2 and depot48-2-3 respectively.

This plan assumes that the hoist can only carry one crate at a time and that the hoist must return to the loadarea between each crate movement. This plan moves all crates to depot48 in the most efficient manner possible given these constraints.
