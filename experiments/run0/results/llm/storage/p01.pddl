Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 from depot48-1-1 to loadarea. The hoist is now in the transit area (loadarea).

2. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 from loadarea to container-0-0. The hoist is now in the container store area.

3. "lift" action: Lift crate0 from container-0-0 using hoist0. The hoist is now lifting the crate and the container store area is clear.

4. "go-out" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from container-0-0 to loadarea. The hoist with the crate is now in the transit area.

5. "go-in" action: Move hoist0 with crate0 from loadarea to depot48-1-1. The hoist with the crate is now in the depot store area.

6. "drop" action: Drop crate0 from hoist0 onto depot48-1-1. The crate is now in the depot store area and the hoist is available again.

This plan ensures that all crates are moved to depot48, fulfilling the goal of the problem.
