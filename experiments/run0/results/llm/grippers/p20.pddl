Given the current state of the world and the goal state, it appears that the balls are already in their destination rooms. Ball1 is in room2 and Ball2 is in room3, which are their respective destinations. Therefore, no actions are required to achieve the goal state. The robots can remain in their current positions with their grippers free. 

However, if you meant that the balls need to be moved to a different room, please provide the correct destination rooms for each ball.
