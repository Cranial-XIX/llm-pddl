Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 uses the left gripper to pick up ball2 in room2.
2. Robot1 uses the right gripper to pick up ball5 in room2.
3. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
4. Robot1 drops ball2 in room1 using the left gripper.
5. Robot1 moves from room1 to room3.
6. Robot1 drops ball5 in room3 using the right gripper.
7. Robot1 moves from room3 to room1.
8. Robot1 uses the left gripper to pick up ball4 in room1.
9. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
10. Robot1 drops ball4 in room2 using the left gripper.

This plan ensures that all balls are in their correct rooms. Ball1 and ball3 are already in their correct rooms, so they don't need to be moved. Ball2, ball4, and ball5 are moved to their correct rooms using the least amount of steps.
