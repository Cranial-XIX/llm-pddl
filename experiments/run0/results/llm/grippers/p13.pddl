Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Move action: Move robot1 from room1 to room3.
2. Pick action: Use robot1's left gripper to pick up ball1 in room3.
3. Pick action: Use robot1's right gripper to pick up ball2 in room3.
4. Move action: Move robot1 from room3 to room1.
5. Drop action: Use robot1's left gripper to drop ball1 in room1.
6. Drop action: Use robot1's right gripper to drop ball2 in room1.

This plan is optimal because it minimizes the number of actions required to achieve the goal. The robot uses both grippers to carry both balls at the same time, reducing the number of trips between rooms.
