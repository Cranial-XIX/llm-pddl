Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Pick action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball1 in room2. (Since ball1 is already in its destination room, the robot just needs to hold it to prevent it from being moved accidentally in the following steps.)

2. Pick action: Robot1 uses its right gripper to pick up ball5 in room2. (Same reason as above.)

3. Move action: Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.

4. Drop action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to drop ball1 in room1. (Temporarily, as the robot needs to free up a gripper for the next steps.)

5. Pick action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball2 in room1.

6. Move action: Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.

7. Drop action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to drop ball2 in room4. (Now ball2 is in its destination room.)

8. Move action: Robot1 moves from room4 to room1.

9. Pick action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball3 in room1.

10. Move action: Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.

11. Drop action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to drop ball3 in room4. (Now ball3 is in its destination room.)

12. Move action: Robot1 moves from room4 to room1.

13. Pick action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball1 in room1. (Picking up ball1 again to move it back to its destination room.)

14. Move action: Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.

15. Drop action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to drop ball1 in room2. (Now ball1 is back in its destination room.)

Now all balls are in their destination rooms. The robot's grippers are free and it can be used for other tasks.
