Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 picks up ball1 using its left gripper in room3.
2. Robot2 picks up ball4 using its right gripper in room3.
3. Robot2 moves from room3 to room2.
4. Robot2 drops ball1 in room2.
5. Robot2 moves from room2 to room3.
6. Robot2 drops ball4 in room3.

Meanwhile,

7. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
8. Robot1 picks up ball2 using its left gripper in room1.
9. Robot1 picks up ball3 using its right gripper in room1.
10. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
11. Robot1 drops ball2 in room2.
12. Robot1 moves from room2 to room3.
13. Robot1 drops ball3 in room3.

This plan ensures that all balls are transported to their respective rooms in the most efficient way possible.
