Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 picks up ball1 with left gripper in room4.
2. Robot1 moves from room4 to room1.
3. Robot1 drops ball1 in room1.
4. Robot1 moves from room1 to room4.
5. Robot1 picks up ball2 with left gripper in room4.
6. Robot1 drops ball2 in room4.

7. Robot2 picks up ball6 with left gripper in room1.
8. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
9. Robot2 drops ball6 in room2.
10. Robot2 moves from room2 to room1.
11. Robot2 picks up ball7 with left gripper in room1.
12. Robot2 drops ball7 in room1.

13. Robot3 picks up ball3 with left gripper in room3.
14. Robot3 drops ball3 in room3.
15. Robot3 picks up ball5 with right gripper in room3.
16. Robot3 moves from room3 to room2.
17. Robot3 drops ball5 in room2.
18. Robot3 moves from room2 to room3.
19. Robot3 picks up ball4 with right gripper in room3.
20. Robot3 moves from room3 to room4.
21. Robot3 drops ball4 in room4.

This plan assumes that each robot can only carry one ball at a time with each gripper, and that the robots can move between rooms freely. The plan also assumes that the robots can pick up and drop balls without any time or resource constraints.
