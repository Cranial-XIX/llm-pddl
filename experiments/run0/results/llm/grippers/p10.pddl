Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot3 picks up ball1 with its left gripper in room2.
2. Robot3 picks up ball2 with its right gripper in room2.
3. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
4. Robot3 drops ball1 in room1.
5. Robot3 drops ball2 in room1.
6. Robot3 moves from room1 to room2.
7. Robot3 picks up ball3 with its left gripper in room2.
8. Robot3 picks up ball4 with its right gripper in room2.
9. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
10. Robot3 drops ball3 in room1.
11. Robot3 drops ball4 in room1.

This plan assumes that the robots can carry two balls at once (one in each gripper) and that they can move while carrying balls. It also assumes that the robots can pick up and drop balls in any order. If these assumptions are not correct, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
