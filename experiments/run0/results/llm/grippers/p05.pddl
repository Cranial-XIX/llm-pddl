Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 picks up ball3 using its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot2 moves from room1 to room2.
3. Robot2 drops ball3 in room2 using its left gripper.
4. Robot2 moves from room2 to room1.

This plan is optimal because it involves the minimum number of actions necessary to achieve the goal. Since ball1, ball2, ball4, and ball5 are already in their destination room (room1), they do not need to be moved. Only ball3 needs to be transported from room1 to room2.
