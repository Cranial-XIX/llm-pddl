Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball1 in room1.
2. Robot1 uses its right gripper to pick up ball2 in room1.
3. Robot1 moves from room1 to room5.
4. Robot1 drops ball1 in room5 using its left gripper.
5. Robot1 moves from room5 to room4.
6. Robot1 drops ball2 in room4 using its right gripper.

This plan assumes that the robots can carry more than one object at a time and that they can move between any two rooms directly. If the robots can only carry one object at a time or if they can only move between adjacent rooms, the plan would need to be adjusted accordingly.
