Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Move action: Robot1 stays in room1 (since it's already there and two of the balls are already in their correct room).
2. Pick action: Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball3 (since this is the only ball that needs to be moved to another room).
3. Move action: Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
4. Drop action: Robot1 drops ball3 in room2 using its left gripper.

This plan is optimal because it involves the minimum number of actions necessary to achieve the goal. The robot does not need to interact with ball1 and ball2 since they are already in their correct locations.
