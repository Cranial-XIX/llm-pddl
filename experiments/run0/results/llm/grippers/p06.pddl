Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 uses the move action to go from room2 to room1.
2. Robot2 uses the pick action to pick up ball1 in room1 using its left gripper.
3. Robot2 uses the move action to go from room1 to room3.
4. Robot2 uses the drop action to drop ball1 in room3 from its left gripper.

This plan is optimal because it involves the minimum number of actions necessary to achieve the goal. It uses one robot to perform all the actions, thus avoiding unnecessary movements of the other robot.
