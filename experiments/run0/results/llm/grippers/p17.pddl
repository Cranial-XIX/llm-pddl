Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 picks up ball1 using its left gripper in room1.
2. Robot1 picks up ball5 using its right gripper in room1.
3. Robot1 moves from room1 to room2.
4. Robot1 drops ball1 in room2 using its left gripper.
5. Robot1 moves from room2 to room1.
6. Robot1 drops ball5 in room1 using its right gripper.

7. Robot4 picks up ball5 using its left gripper in room1.
8. Robot4 moves from room1 to room2.
9. Robot4 drops ball5 in room2 using its left gripper.

10. Robot3 picks up ball3 using its left gripper in room2.
11. Robot3 picks up ball4 using its right gripper in room2.
12. Robot3 moves from room2 to room1.
13. Robot3 drops ball3 in room1 using its left gripper.
14. Robot3 drops ball4 in room1 using its right gripper.

This plan ensures that all balls are transported to their respective rooms in the most efficient way possible.
