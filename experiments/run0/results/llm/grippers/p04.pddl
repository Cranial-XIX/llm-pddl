Given the current state of the world and the goal state, it seems that ball1 and ball2 are already in their destination rooms. Therefore, the robots do not need to move these balls. The optimal plan would be to move ball3 and ball4 to their respective rooms. Here is a sequence of actions that the robots can take:

1. Robot1 uses its left gripper to pick up ball3 in room1.
2. Robot1 moves from room1 to room3.
3. Robot1 drops ball3 in room3 using its left gripper.
4. Meanwhile, Robot2 moves from room4 to room2.
5. Robot2 uses its right gripper to pick up ball4 in room2.
6. Since ball4 is already in its destination room, Robot2 drops ball4 in room2 using its right gripper.

This plan assumes that the robots can perform actions simultaneously. If the robots must act sequentially, then the actions would need to be ordered appropriately.
