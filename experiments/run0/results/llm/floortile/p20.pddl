Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles in the desired pattern:

Robot1 starts at tile_3-5 and Robot2 starts at tile_6-3.

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_3-5.
3. Robot1 moves left.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-4.
6. Robot1 moves left.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-3.
9. Robot1 moves left.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_3-2.
12. Robot1 moves left.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_3-1.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start painting from tile_6-3.

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_6-3.
3. Robot2 moves right.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_6-4.
6. Robot2 moves right.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_6-5.
9. Robot2 moves left twice.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot2 paints tile_6-2.
12. Robot2 moves left.
13. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot2 paints tile_6-1.

After this, both robots will continue to move up and down the rows, alternating colors as they go, until all tiles are painted as per the pattern. The robots will need to coordinate their movements to avoid painting a tile that the other robot needs to stand on.
