Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot2 moves right.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot2 moves right.

Meanwhile,

7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
9. Robot1 moves right.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.
12. Robot1 moves down.

Then,

13. Robot2 moves down.
14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot2 paints tile_2-1 black.
16. Robot2 moves right.
17. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
18. Robot2 paints tile_2-2 white.
19. Robot2 moves right.

At the same time,

20. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
21. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 black.
22. Robot1 moves right.
23. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
24. Robot1 paints tile_2-4 white.
25. Robot1 moves down.

Next,

26. Robot2 moves down.
27. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
28. Robot2 paints tile_3-1 white.
29. Robot2 moves right.
30. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
31. Robot2 paints tile_3-2 black.
32. Robot2 moves right.

Simultaneously,

33. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
34. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.
35. Robot1 moves right.
36. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
37. Robot1 paints tile_3-4 black.
38. Robot1 moves down.

After that,

39. Robot2 moves down.
40. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
41. Robot2 paints tile_4-1 black.
42. Robot2 moves right.
43. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
44. Robot2 paints tile_4-2 white.
45. Robot2 moves right.

In parallel,

46. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
47. Robot1 paints tile_4-3 black.
48. Robot1 moves right.
49. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
50. Robot1 paints tile_4-4 white.
51. Robot1 moves down.

Finally,

52. Robot2 moves down.
53. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
54. Robot2 paints tile_5-1 white.
55. Robot2 moves right.
56. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
57. Robot2 paints tile_5-2 black.
58. Robot2 moves right.

Concurrently,

59. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
60. Robot1 paints tile_5-3 white.
61. Robot1 moves right.
62. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
63. Robot1 paints tile_5-4 black.

This plan ensures that each robot paints the tiles in the correct color and sequence, without stepping on any painted tiles.
