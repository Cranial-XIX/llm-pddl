Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles in the desired pattern:

Robot1 starts at tile_0-5 and Robot2 starts at tile_3-3.

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 moves down to tile_1-5.
3. Robot1 paints tile_1-5 white.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 moves left to tile_1-4.
6. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.
7. Robot1 continues this pattern until it reaches tile_1-1.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start painting from tile_3-3.

8. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
9. Robot2 paints tile_3-3 white.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-4.
12. Robot2 paints tile_3-4 black.
13. Robot2 continues this pattern until it reaches tile_3-5.

After Robot1 finishes painting the first row, it moves down to the second row and starts painting from tile_2-5 to tile_2-1. Similarly, after Robot2 finishes painting the third row, it moves down to the fourth row and starts painting from tile_4-3 to tile_4-5.

This process continues until all the tiles are painted as per the desired pattern. The robots alternate the spray gun color and direction of movement for each row to achieve the pattern.
