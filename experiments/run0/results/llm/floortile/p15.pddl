Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles in the desired pattern:

Robot1 starts at tile_3-4 and Robot2 starts at tile_5-5.

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_3-4.
3. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-3.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-3.
6. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-2.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-2.
9. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-1.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_3-1.

Meanwhile, Robot2 starts painting from tile_5-5.

12. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
13. Robot2 paints tile_5-5.
14. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-4.
15. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
16. Robot2 paints tile_5-4.
17. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-3.
18. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
19. Robot2 paints tile_5-3.
20. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-2.
21. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
22. Robot2 paints tile_5-2.
23. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-1.
24. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
25. Robot2 paints tile_5-1.

Now, Robot1 moves up to the next row and starts painting from right to left, while Robot2 moves down to the next row and starts painting from right to left. They continue this pattern until all the tiles are painted as per the desired pattern. 

Please note that the robots can only paint the tile in front of them, so they need to move in the opposite direction of the painting sequence. Also, they need to change the color of their spray gun before painting each tile.
