Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
3. Robot1 paints tile_6-1 black.
4. Robot2 paints tile_6-2 white.
5. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_5-1 black.
6. Robot2 moves up and paints tile_5-2 white.
7. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_5-3 black.
8. Robot2 moves right and paints tile_5-4 white.
9. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_5-5 black.
10. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_4-1 black.
11. Robot2 moves up and paints tile_4-2 white.
12. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_4-3 black.
13. Robot2 moves right and paints tile_4-4 white.
14. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_4-5 black.
15. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_3-1 black.
16. Robot2 moves up and paints tile_3-2 white.
17. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_3-3 black.
18. Robot2 moves right and paints tile_3-4 white.
19. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_3-5 black.
20. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_2-1 black.
21. Robot2 moves up and paints tile_2-2 white.
22. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_2-3 black.
23. Robot2 moves right and paints tile_2-4 white.
24. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_2-5 black.
25. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_1-1 black.
26. Robot2 moves up and paints tile_1-2 white.
27. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_1-3 black.
28. Robot2 moves right and paints tile_1-4 white.
29. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_1-5 black.

This plan ensures that each tile is painted in the correct color, and no robot moves onto a painted tile.
