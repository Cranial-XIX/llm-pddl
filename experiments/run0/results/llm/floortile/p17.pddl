Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
3. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-3.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
6. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-4.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.
9. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-5.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_1-5 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start painting from tile_0-5 and move downwards:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 moves down to tile_1-5.
3. Robot2 paints tile_1-5 white.
4. Robot2 moves down to tile_2-5.
5. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
6. Robot2 paints tile_2-5 black.
7. Robot2 moves down to tile_3-5.
8. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
9. Robot2 paints tile_3-5 white.
10. Robot2 moves down to tile_4-5.
11. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
12. Robot2 paints tile_4-5 black.
13. Robot2 moves down to tile_5-5.
14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
15. Robot2 paints tile_5-5 white.

This process continues until all tiles are painted according to the pattern. The robots will need to coordinate their movements and color changes to ensure they do not paint over each other's tiles or move onto a painted tile.
