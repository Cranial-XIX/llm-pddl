Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_1-3.
3. Robot1 moves left.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_1-2.
6. Robot1 moves left.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-1.
9. Robot1 moves right.
10. Robot1 moves down.
11. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
12. Robot1 paints tile_2-2.
13. Robot1 moves right.
14. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
15. Robot1 paints tile_2-3.
16. Robot1 moves right.
17. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
18. Robot1 paints tile_2-4.

Meanwhile, Robot2 can start painting from its position:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_5-2.
3. Robot2 moves right.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_5-3.
6. Robot2 moves right.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_5-4.
9. Robot2 moves left.
10. Robot2 moves up.
11. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
12. Robot2 paints tile_4-3.
13. Robot2 moves left.
14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot2 paints tile_4-2.
16. Robot2 moves left.
17. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
18. Robot2 paints tile_4-1.

After Robot1 finishes painting the second row, it can move up and start painting the third row while Robot2 moves up to paint the remaining tiles in the fourth row. They can continue this pattern until all tiles are painted according to the pattern.
