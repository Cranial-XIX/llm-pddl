Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

Robot1 starts at tile_4-1 and Robot2 starts at tile_0-3.

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot1 moves up.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.
6. Robot1 moves right.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
9. Robot1 moves right.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.
12. Robot1 moves right.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot1 paints tile_3-4 black.
15. Robot1 moves right.
16. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot1 paints tile_3-5 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 will start painting from tile_0-3.

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 moves down.
3. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 white.
4. Robot2 moves left.
5. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
6. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 black.
7. Robot2 moves left.
8. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
9. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 white.
10. Robot2 moves right twice.
11. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
12. Robot2 paints tile_1-4 black.
13. Robot2 moves right.
14. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
15. Robot2 paints tile_1-5 white.

After this, both robots will continue to paint the remaining tiles following the same pattern until all tiles are painted as per the goal.
