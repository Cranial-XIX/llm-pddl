Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot2 moves right.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_4-2 white.
6. Robot2 moves right.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_4-3 black.

Meanwhile, Robot1 can follow these steps:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
3. Robot1 moves left.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.
6. Robot1 moves right twice.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.
9. Robot1 moves up.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_2-2 black.
12. Robot1 moves left.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 white.
15. Robot1 moves right twice.
16. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 white.
18. Robot1 moves up.
19. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
20. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
21. Robot1 moves left.
22. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
23. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.
24. Robot1 moves right twice.
25. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
26. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot steps on a painted tile.
