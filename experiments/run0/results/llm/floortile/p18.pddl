Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_1-5 white.
3. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-4.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot2 paints tile_1-4 black.
6. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-3.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 white.
9. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-2.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 black.
12. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-1.
13. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 white.

Meanwhile, Robot1 can start painting from tile_5-3:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_5-3 white.
3. Robot1 moves right to tile_5-4.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_5-4 black.
6. Robot1 moves right to tile_5-5.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_5-5 white.
9. Robot1 moves left to tile_5-2.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_5-2 black.
12. Robot1 moves left to tile_5-1.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_5-1 white.

After this, both robots can move up and down to paint the remaining tiles following the same pattern. They should always change their spray gun color before painting a tile and move to the next tile after painting. They should also make sure not to move to a tile that has already been painted.
