Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_2-2.
3. Robot1 moves up and paints tile_1-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_1-3.
6. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
7. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_1-4.
8. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
9. Robot1 moves right and paints tile_1-5.

Meanwhile, Robot2 follows these steps:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_5-4.
3. Robot2 moves left and paints tile_5-3.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 moves left and paints tile_5-2.
6. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
7. Robot2 moves left and paints tile_5-1.

After this, Robot1 moves down and starts painting the 2nd row while Robot2 moves up and starts painting the 4th row. They continue this pattern until all rows are painted. 

Please note that the robots need to change their spray gun color every time they move to a new tile. Also, they should always move in a way that they don't step on a painted tile.
