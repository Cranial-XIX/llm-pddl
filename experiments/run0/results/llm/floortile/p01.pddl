Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot1 moves up.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.
6. Robot1 moves up.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 black.
9. Robot1 moves up.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 follows a similar sequence:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_4-3 black.
3. Robot2 moves up.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_3-3 white.
6. Robot2 moves up.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_2-3 black.
9. Robot2 moves up.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 white.

For the middle column, either robot can do the following after completing their side:

1. Robot moves right.
2. Robot changes its spray gun color to white.
3. Robot paints tile_4-2 white.
4. Robot moves up.
5. Robot changes its spray gun color to black.
6. Robot paints tile_3-2 black.
7. Robot moves up.
8. Robot changes its spray gun color to white.
9. Robot paints tile_2-2 white.
10. Robot moves up.
11. Robot changes its spray gun color to black.
12. Robot paints tile_1-2 black.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot steps on a painted tile.
