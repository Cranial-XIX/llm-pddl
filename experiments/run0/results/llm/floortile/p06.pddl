Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

Robot1 starts at tile_1-1 and Robot2 starts at tile_0-3.

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_1-1 white.
3. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-2.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_1-2 black.
6. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-3.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_1-3 white.
9. Robot1 moves right to tile_1-4.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_1-4 black.

Meanwhile, Robot2 can start painting the second row from the right side:

1. Robot2 moves down to tile_1-3.
2. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
3. Robot2 paints tile_1-3 black.
4. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-2.
5. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
6. Robot2 paints tile_1-2 white.
7. Robot2 moves left to tile_1-1.
8. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
9. Robot2 paints tile_1-1 black.

After Robot1 finishes the first row, it can move down to the third row and start painting from the left side, while Robot2 can move down to the second row and start painting from the right side. They can continue this pattern until all the tiles are painted according to the goal.
