Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

Robot1 Actions:
1. Change the spray gun color to white
2. Move down
3. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_0-3)
4. Move left
5. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_0-2)
6. Move left
7. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_0-1)
8. Change the spray gun color to black
9. Move down
10. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_1-2)
11. Move right
12. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_1-3)
13. Move right
14. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_1-4)

Robot2 Actions:
1. Change the spray gun color to black
2. Move down
3. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_3-4)
4. Move left
5. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_3-3)
6. Move left
7. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_3-2)
8. Change the spray gun color to white
9. Move down
10. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_4-3)
11. Move left
12. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_4-2)
13. Move left
14. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_4-1)

This plan assumes that the robots can paint the tile that is up from them, even if they have just moved down onto it. If this is not the case, the robots would need to move down, then up, then paint, which would add extra steps to the plan.
