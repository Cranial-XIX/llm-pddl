Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-2 white.
3. Robot1 moves left to tile_4-1.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot1 paints tile_4-1 black.
6. Robot1 moves up to tile_3-1.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.
9. Robot1 moves right to tile_3-2.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
12. Robot1 moves right to tile_3-3.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot1 paints tile_3-3 white.

Meanwhile, Robot2 follows these steps:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_5-3 white.
3. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-2.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot2 paints tile_5-2 black.
6. Robot2 moves left to tile_5-1.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot2 paints tile_5-1 white.
9. Robot2 moves up to tile_4-3.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot2 paints tile_4-3 black.

After this, Robot1 moves down to tile_2-1 and Robot2 moves up to tile_1-3, and they repeat the same sequence of actions (change color, paint, move) until all tiles are painted as per the pattern.
