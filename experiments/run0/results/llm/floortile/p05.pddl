Sure, here is an optimal plan for the robots to paint the tiles according to the pattern:

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 paints tile_4-1.
3. Robot1 moves right.
4. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot1 paints tile_4-2.
6. Robot1 moves right.
7. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot1 paints tile_4-3.
9. Robot1 moves right.
10. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot1 paints tile_4-4.

Meanwhile, Robot2 can start painting from its position:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
2. Robot2 paints tile_2-4.
3. Robot2 moves left.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
5. Robot2 paints tile_2-3.
6. Robot2 moves left.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
8. Robot2 paints tile_2-2.
9. Robot2 moves left.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
11. Robot2 paints tile_2-1.

After Robot1 finishes painting the 4th row, it can move up to the 3rd row:

12. Robot1 moves up.
13. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
14. Robot1 paints tile_3-1.
15. Robot1 moves right.
16. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
17. Robot1 paints tile_3-2.
18. Robot1 moves right.
19. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
20. Robot1 paints tile_3-3.
21. Robot1 moves right.
22. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
23. Robot1 paints tile_3-4.

After Robot2 finishes painting the 2nd row, it can move up to the 1st row:

12. Robot2 moves up.
13. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
14. Robot2 paints tile_1-1.
15. Robot2 moves right.
16. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
17. Robot2 paints tile_1-2.
18. Robot2 moves right.
19. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
20. Robot2 paints tile_1-3.
21. Robot2 moves right.
22. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
23. Robot2 paints tile_1-4.

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot steps on a painted tile.
