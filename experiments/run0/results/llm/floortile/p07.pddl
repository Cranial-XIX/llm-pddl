Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot2 paints tile_4-1 black.
3. Robot2 moves up to tile_3-1.
4. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
5. Robot2 paints tile_3-1 white.
6. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-2.
7. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to black.
8. Robot2 paints tile_3-2 black.
9. Robot2 moves right to tile_3-3.
10. Robot2 changes its spray gun color to white.
11. Robot2 paints tile_3-3 white.

Meanwhile, 

1. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
2. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-2.
3. Robot1 paints tile_3-2 black.
4. Robot1 moves left to tile_3-1.
5. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
6. Robot1 paints tile_3-1 white.
7. Robot1 moves up to tile_2-1.
8. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
9. Robot1 paints tile_2-1 black.
10. Robot1 moves right to tile_2-2.
11. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to white.
12. Robot1 paints tile_2-2 white.
13. Robot1 moves right to tile_2-3.
14. Robot1 changes its spray gun color to black.
15. Robot1 paints tile_2-3 black.

After this, Robot2 can continue to paint the remaining tiles in the lower rows, and Robot1 can continue to paint the remaining tiles in the upper rows, following the same pattern of changing colors and moving.
