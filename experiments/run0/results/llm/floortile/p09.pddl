Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

For Robot1:
1. Change the spray gun color to white.
2. Move down to tile_1-3.
3. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_1-3).
4. Move down to tile_2-3.
5. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_2-3).
6. Move down to tile_3-3.
7. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_3-3).
8. Move down to tile_4-3.
9. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_4-3).
10. Move down to tile_5-3.
11. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_5-3).

For Robot2:
1. Change the spray gun color to black.
2. Paint the tile that is down from the robot (tile_4-2).
3. Move up to tile_3-2.
4. Paint the tile that is down from the robot (tile_3-2).
5. Move up to tile_2-2.
6. Paint the tile that is down from the robot (tile_2-2).
7. Move up to tile_1-2.
8. Paint the tile that is down from the robot (tile_1-2).
9. Change the spray gun color to white.
10. Move left to tile_1-1.
11. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_1-1).
12. Move down to tile_2-1.
13. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_2-1).
14. Move down to tile_3-1.
15. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_3-1).
16. Move down to tile_4-1.
17. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_4-1).
18. Move down to tile_5-1.
19. Paint the tile that is up from the robot (tile_5-1).

This plan ensures that all tiles are painted according to the pattern and no robot moves onto a painted tile.
