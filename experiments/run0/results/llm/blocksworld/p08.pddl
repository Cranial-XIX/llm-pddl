Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b6 from b4. Now the arm is holding b6 and b4 is clear.
2. Putdown b6 on the table. Now the arm is empty and b6 is on the table and clear.
3. Unstack b4 from b5. Now the arm is holding b4 and b5 is clear.
4. Putdown b4 on the table. Now the arm is empty and b4 is on the table and clear.
5. Unstack b5 from b1. Now the arm is holding b5 and b1 is clear.
6. Stack b5 on b3. Now the arm is empty, b5 is on top of b3, and b3 is no longer clear.
7. Unstack b1 from b3. Now the arm is holding b1 and b3 is clear.
8. Stack b1 on b6. Now the arm is empty, b1 is on top of b6, and b6 is no longer clear.
9. Pickup b4 from the table. Now the arm is holding b4 and b4 is no longer on the table or clear.
10. Stack b4 on b1. Now the arm is empty, b4 is on top of b1, and b1 is no longer clear.
11. Pickup b6 from the table. Now the arm is holding b6 and b6 is no longer on the table or clear.
12. Stack b6 on b2. Now the arm is empty, b6 is on top of b2, and b2 is no longer clear.

Now, b1 is on top of b6, b3 is on top of b5, and b6 is on top of b2, which is the desired goal state.
