Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b5 from b2. Now, the arm is holding b5.
2. Putdown b5 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b5 is on the table and clear.
3. Unstack b2 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b2.
4. Putdown b2 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b2 is on the table and clear.
5. Pickup b3. Now, the arm is holding b3.
6. Stack b3 on b5. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on top of b5, and b5 is no longer clear.
7. Pickup b4 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b4.
8. Stack b4 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is on top of b3, and b3 is no longer clear.

This plan will result in the desired configuration: b4 is on top of b3, and b3 is on top of b5. The other blocks (b1, b2, b6) remain in their original positions.
