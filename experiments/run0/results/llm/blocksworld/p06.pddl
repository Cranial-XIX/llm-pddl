Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b5 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b5 and b3 is clear.
2. Putdown b5 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b5 is clear and on the table.
3. Unstack b3 from b4. Now, the arm is holding b3 and b4 is clear.
4. Stack b3 on b5. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on top of b5 and b5 is not clear.
5. Unstack b4 from b2. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b2 is clear.
6. Putdown b4 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b4 is clear and on the table.
7. Unstack b2 from b1. Now, the arm is holding b2 and b1 is clear.
8. Stack b2 on b1. Now, the arm is empty, b2 is on top of b1 and b1 is not clear.
9. Pickup b4 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b4 is not clear.
10. Stack b4 on b1. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is on top of b1 and b1 is not clear.

Now, the blocks are arranged as per the goal: b1 is on top of b2, b3 is on top of b5, and b4 is on top of b1.
