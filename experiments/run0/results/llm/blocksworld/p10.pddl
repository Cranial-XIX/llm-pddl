Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b6 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b6 and b3 is clear.
2. Putdown b6 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b6 is clear.
3. Unstack b4 from b7. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b7 is clear.
4. Putdown b4 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b4 is clear.
5. Pickup b1 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b1.
6. Stack b1 on b7. Now, the arm is empty and b1 is on top of b7.
7. Pickup b4 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b4.
8. Stack b4 on b1. Now, the arm is empty and b4 is on top of b1.
9. Pickup b6 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b6.
10. Stack b6 on b5. Now, the arm is empty and b6 is on top of b5.
11. Pickup b3 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b3.
12. Stack b3 on b2. Now, the arm is empty and b3 is on top of b2.
13. Pickup b7 (with b1 and b4 on top) from the table. Now, the arm is holding b7.
14. Stack b7 (with b1 and b4 on top) on b3. Now, the arm is empty and b7 is on top of b3.

This plan will result in the desired configuration of blocks.
