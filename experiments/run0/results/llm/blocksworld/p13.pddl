Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b5 from b2 (b5 is now in the arm, b2 is clear)
2. Putdown b5 on the table (b5 is now on the table and clear, arm is empty)
3. Unstack b2 from b3 (b2 is now in the arm, b3 is clear)
4. Stack b2 on b5 (b2 is now on top of b5, arm is empty)
5. Unstack b8 from b6 (b8 is now in the arm, b6 is clear)
6. Stack b8 on b7 (b8 is now on top of b7, arm is empty)
7. Unstack b6 from b9 (b6 is now in the arm, b9 is clear)
8. Stack b6 on b4 (b6 is now on top of b4, arm is empty)
9. Unstack b9 from b5 (b9 is now in the arm, b5 is clear)
10. Stack b9 on b2 (b9 is now on top of b2, arm is empty)
11. Pickup b4 from the table (b4 is now in the arm)
12. Stack b4 on b8 (b4 is now on top of b8, arm is empty)

This plan assumes that the blocks are moved one at a time and that the arm can only hold one block at a time. The plan also assumes that the blocks are stable when stacked and do not fall over.
