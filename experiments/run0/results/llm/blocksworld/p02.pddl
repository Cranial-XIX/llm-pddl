Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b1 from b3: This will leave b1 in the arm, b3 clear and on top of b2, and b2 on the table.
2. Putdown b1 on the table: This will leave the arm empty, b1 clear and on the table, b3 clear and on top of b2, and b2 on the table.
3. Unstack b3 from b2: This will leave b3 in the arm, b2 clear and on the table, and b1 clear and on the table.
4. Stack b3 on b1: This will leave the arm empty, b3 on top of b1 and not clear, b1 not clear and on the table, and b2 clear and on the table.
5. Pickup b2 from the table: This will leave b2 in the arm and not clear, b3 on top of b1 and not clear, b1 not clear and on the table.
6. Stack b2 on b3: This will leave the arm empty, b2 on top of b3 and not clear, b3 on top of b1 and not clear, and b1 clear and on the table.

Now, b2 is on top of b3, b3 is on top of b1, and the arm is empty, which is the desired goal state.
