Given the current state of the blocks and the goal state, here is a sequence of actions that could be taken to reach the goal:

1. Unstack b7 from b1. (This leaves b7 in the arm and b1 clear on the table.)
2. Putdown b7 on the table. (This leaves the arm empty and b7 clear on the table.)
3. Unstack b2 from b3. (This leaves b2 in the arm and b3 clear on top of b6.)
4. Putdown b2 on the table. (This leaves the arm empty and b2 clear on the table.)
5. Unstack b5 from b4. (This leaves b5 in the arm and b4 clear on top of b2.)
6. Stack b5 on b3. (This leaves the arm empty, b5 on top of b3, and b3 no longer clear.)
7. Pickup b1 from the table. (This leaves b1 in the arm and the table clear.)
8. Stack b1 on b5. (This leaves the arm empty, b1 on top of b5, and b5 no longer clear.)
9. Pickup b2 from the table. (This leaves b2 in the arm and the table clear.)
10. Stack b2 on b10. (This leaves the arm empty, b2 on top of b10, and b10 no longer clear.)
11. Pickup b7 from the table. (This leaves b7 in the arm and the table clear.)
12. Stack b7 on b4. (This leaves the arm empty, b7 on top of b4, and b4 no longer clear.)
13. Pickup b8 from the table. (This leaves b8 in the arm and the table clear.)
14. Stack b8 on b7. (This leaves the arm empty, b8 on top of b7, and b7 no longer clear.)
15. Pickup b9 from the table. (This leaves b9 in the arm and the table clear.)
16. Stack b9 on b2. (This leaves the arm empty, b9 on top of b2, and b2 no longer clear.)
17. Pickup b10 from the table. (This leaves b10 in the arm and the table clear.)
18. Stack b10 on b8. (This leaves the arm empty, b10 on top of b8, and b8 no longer clear.)

This sequence of actions should result in the desired configuration of blocks.
