Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b3 from b1. Now, b3 is in the arm, b1 is clear.
2. Putdown b3 on the table. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on the table and clear.
3. Unstack b1 from b4. Now, b1 is in the arm, b4 is clear.
4. Stack b1 on b2. Now, the arm is empty, b1 is on top of b2, b2 is not clear.
5. Pickup b3 from the table. Now, b3 is in the arm, the arm is not empty.
6. Stack b3 on b4. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on top of b4, b4 is not clear.
7. Pickup b2 (with b1 on top of it) from the table. Now, b2 is in the arm, the arm is not empty.
8. Stack b2 (with b1 on top of it) on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b2 is on top of b3, b3 is not clear, and b1 is on top of b2.

Now, the blocks are arranged as per the goal: b1 is on top of b2, b2 is on top of b3, and b3 is on top of b4.
