Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b4 from b7. Now, the arm is holding b4, b7 is clear.
2. Putdown b4 on the table. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is clear and on the table.
3. Unstack b7 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b7, b3 is clear.
4. Stack b7 on b4. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is not clear.
5. Unstack b3 from b6. Now, the arm is holding b3, b6 is clear.
6. Stack b3 on b7. Now, the arm is empty, b7 is not clear.
7. Pickup b5 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b5, b5 is not on the table.
8. Stack b5 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is not clear.
9. Pickup b6 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b6, b6 is not on the table.
10. Stack b6 on b5. Now, the arm is empty, b5 is not clear.
11. Pickup b2 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b2, b2 is not on the table.
12. Stack b2 on b6. Now, the arm is empty, b6 is not clear.
13. Pickup b1 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b1, b1 is not on the table.
14. Stack b1 on b2. Now, the arm is empty, b2 is not clear.

Now, the blocks are arranged as per the goal: b1 is on top of b2, b2 is on top of b6, b3 is on top of b7, b5 is on top of b3, b6 is on top of b5, and b7 is on top of b4.
