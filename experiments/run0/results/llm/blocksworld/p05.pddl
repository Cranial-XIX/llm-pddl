Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b4 from b1. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b1 is clear.
2. Putdown b4 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b4 is clear and on the table.
3. Unstack b1 from b2. Now, the arm is holding b1 and b2 is clear.
4. Putdown b1 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b1 is clear and on the table.
5. Unstack b2 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b2 and b3 is clear.
6. Putdown b2 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b2 is clear and on the table.
7. Pickup b1 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b1 and b1 is no longer on the table or clear.
8. Stack b1 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b1 is on top of b3, and b3 is no longer clear.

Now, b1 is on top of b3 and b3 is on top of b5, as required.
