Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b1 from b3: This will leave b1 in the arm, b3 clear and on top of b2.
2. Putdown b1 on the table: This will leave b1 clear and on the table, and the arm empty.
3. Unstack b3 from b2: This will leave b3 in the arm, b2 clear and on the table.
4. Stack b3 on b4: This will leave b3 on top of b4, b4 not clear, and the arm empty.
5. Pickup b1 from the table: This will leave b1 in the arm and no longer on the table or clear.
6. Stack b1 on b2: This will leave b1 on top of b2, b2 not clear, and the arm empty.

Now, b2 is on top of b1 and b3 is on top of b4, which is the goal state.
