Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b7 from b8. Now, the arm is holding b7 and b8 is clear.
2. Putdown b7 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b7 is clear.
3. Unstack b8 from b1. Now, the arm is holding b8 and b1 is clear.
4. Stack b8 on b2. Now, the arm is empty, b8 is on top of b2 and b2 is not clear.
5. Unstack b1 from b6. Now, the arm is holding b1 and b6 is clear.
6. Stack b1 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b1 is on top of b3 and b3 is not clear.
7. Unstack b6 from b4. Now, the arm is holding b6 and b4 is clear.
8. Stack b6 on b5. Now, the arm is empty, b6 is on top of b5 and b5 is not clear.
9. Pickup b4 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b4 is not clear.
10. Stack b4 on b7. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is on top of b7 and b7 is not clear.
11. Pickup b7 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b7 and b7 is not clear.
12. Stack b7 on b1. Now, the arm is empty, b7 is on top of b1 and b1 is not clear.
13. Pickup b3 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b3 and b3 is not clear.
14. Stack b3 on b2. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on top of b2 and b2 is not clear.

This plan will result in the following configuration: b1 is on top of b3, b2 is on top of b8, b3 is on top of b2, b4 is on top of b7, b5 is on top of b6, b6 is on top of b4, and b7 is on top of b1.
