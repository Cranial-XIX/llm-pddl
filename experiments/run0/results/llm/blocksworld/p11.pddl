Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. Unstack b8 from b3. Now, the arm is holding b8 and b3 is clear.
2. Putdown b8 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b8 is clear and on the table.
3. Unstack b7 from b5. Now, the arm is holding b7 and b5 is clear.
4. Stack b7 on b8. Now, the arm is empty, b7 is on top of b8, and b8 is no longer clear.
5. Unstack b5 from b6. Now, the arm is holding b5 and b6 is clear.
6. Stack b5 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b5 is on top of b3, and b3 is no longer clear.
7. Unstack b3 from b7. Now, the arm is holding b3 and b7 is clear.
8. Stack b3 on b5. Now, the arm is empty, b3 is on top of b5, and b5 is no longer clear.
9. Unstack b6 from b4. Now, the arm is holding b6 and b4 is clear.
10. Putdown b6 on the table. Now, the arm is empty and b6 is clear and on the table.
11. Unstack b4 from b2. Now, the arm is holding b4 and b2 is clear.
12. Stack b4 on b2. Now, the arm is empty, b4 is on top of b2, and b2 is no longer clear.
13. Unstack b2 from b1. Now, the arm is holding b2 and b1 is clear.
14. Stack b2 on b3. Now, the arm is empty, b2 is on top of b3, and b3 is no longer clear.
15. Pickup b1 from the table. Now, the arm is holding b1 and b1 is no longer on the table or clear.
16. Stack b1 on b8. Now, the arm is empty, b1 is on top of b8, and b8 is no longer clear.

This plan will result in the desired configuration of blocks.
