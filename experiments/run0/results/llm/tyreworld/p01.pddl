Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "open" action: Open the boot. Now the boot is open and not closed.

2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot. Now the jack is held by the agent and not inside the boot.

3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot. Now the wrench is held by the agent and not inside the boot.

4. "loosen" action: Loosen the nuts on the hub using the wrench. Now the nut on the hub is loose and not tight.

5. "jack-up" action: Jack up the hub using the jack. Now the hub is not on the ground and the agent no longer has the jack.

6. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the hub using the wrench. Now the agent has the nut, the hub is unfastened, and the nut is no longer tight on the hub.

7. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the hub. Now the agent has the flat tyre and the hub is free.

8. "fetch" action: Fetch the intact tyre from the boot. Now the intact tyre is held by the agent and not inside the boot.

9. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre using the pump. Now the intact tyre is inflated.

10. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated tyre onto the hub. Now the inflated tyre is on the hub, the hub is no longer free, and the agent no longer has the tyre.

11. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the hub using the wrench. Now the nut is loose on the hub, the hub is fastened, and the agent no longer has the nut.

12. "jack-down" action: Lower the hub back to the ground using the jack. Now the hub is on the ground and the agent has the jack.

13. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench. Now the nut on the hub is tight and not loose.

14. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot. Now the flat tyre is inside the boot and not held by the agent.

15. "put-away" action: Put the jack in the boot. Now the jack is inside the boot and not held by the agent.

16. "put-away" action: Put the wrench in the boot. Now the wrench is inside the boot and not held by the agent.

17. "put-away" action: Put the pump in the boot. Now the pump is inside the boot and not held by the agent.

18. "close" action: Close the boot. Now the boot is closed and not open.

This plan ensures that the flat tyre is replaced with an inflated tyre on the hub, the nuts are tight on the hub, and all the tools along with the flat tyre are put back in the boot which is then closed.
