3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
6. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre.
7. "jack-up" action: Jack up the first hub.
8. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut on the first hub.
9. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the first hub.
10. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the first hub.
11. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated intact tyre on the first hub.
12. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the first hub.
13. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the first hub.
14. "jack-down" action: Lower the first hub back to the ground.
15. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot.
16. Repeat steps 5-15 for the remaining three hubs.
17. "put-away" action: Put the jack in the boot.
18. "put-away" action: Put the wrench in the boot.
19. "put-away" action: Put the pump in the boot.
20. "close" action: Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres, all the nuts are tight on the hubs, and all the tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
