1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. Repeat the following steps for each of the 13 hubs:
   1. "jack-up" action: Jack up the hub.
   2. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut on the hub.
   3. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the hub.
   4. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   5. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre away in the boot.
   6. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
   7. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre.
   8. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated tyre on the hub.
   9. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the hub.
   10. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the hub.
   11. "jack-down" action: Lower the hub back to the ground.
6. "put-away" action: Put the jack back in the boot.
7. "put-away" action: Put the wrench back in the boot.
8. "put-away" action: Put the pump back in the boot.
9. "close" action: Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated, intact tyres on the hubs, and all tools and flat tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
