Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
6. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
7. "put-away" action: Put the pump back in the boot.
8. "jack-up" action: Jack up the hub with the flat tyre.
9. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut on the hub with the wrench.
10. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the hub.
11. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
12. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot.
13. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated intact tyre on the hub.
14. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the hub.
15. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the hub with the wrench.
16. "jack-down" action: Lower the hub back to the ground.
17. Repeat steps 5-16 for the remaining 15 hubs.
18. "put-away" action: Put the wrench back in the boot.
19. "put-away" action: Put the jack back in the boot.
20. "close" action: Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres, all nuts are tight on the hubs, and all tools and replaced tyres are put back in the boot, which is then closed.
