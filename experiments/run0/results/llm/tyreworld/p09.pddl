Sure, here is an optimal plan to solve the problem:

1. "open" action: Open the boot.
2. "fetch" action: Fetch the jack from the boot.
3. "fetch" action: Fetch the wrench from the boot.
4. "fetch" action: Fetch the pump from the boot.
5. Repeat the following steps for each of the 9 hubs:
   5.1. "loosen" action: Loosen the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   5.2. "jack-up" action: Jack up the hub off the ground.
   5.3. "undo" action: Undo the fastening of the nut on the hub.
   5.4. "remove-wheel" action: Remove the flat tyre from the hub.
   5.5. "fetch" action: Fetch an intact tyre from the boot.
   5.6. "inflate" action: Inflate the intact tyre using the pump.
   5.7. "put-on-wheel" action: Put the inflated tyre onto the hub.
   5.8. "do-up" action: Fasten the nut on the hub.
   5.9. "jack-down" action: Lower the hub back to the ground.
   5.10. "tighten" action: Tighten the nut on the hub using the wrench.
   5.11. "put-away" action: Put the flat tyre in the boot.
6. "put-away" action: Put the jack in the boot.
7. "put-away" action: Put the wrench in the boot.
8. "put-away" action: Put the pump in the boot.
9. "close" action: Close the boot.

This plan ensures that all the flat tyres are replaced with inflated intact tyres on the hubs, the nuts are tight on the hubs, and the flat tyres, wrench, jack, and pump are all in the boot which is closed.
