The PDDL plan is quite complex and it's not straightforward to convert it into a sequence of behaviors without further explanation. However, based on the initial state and the goal state, a possible sequence of behaviors could be:

1. Unstack b5 from b3
2. Putdown b5
3. Unstack b3 from b4
4. Putdown b3
5. Unstack b4 from b2
6. Putdown b4
7. Unstack b2 from b1
8. Putdown b2
9. Pickup b1
10. Stack b1 on b2
11. Pickup b4
12. Stack b4 on b1
13. Pickup b5
14. Stack b5 on b3

Please note that this is just one possible sequence and there could be other sequences that achieve the same goal state.
