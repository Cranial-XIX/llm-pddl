The PDDL plan is quite complex and detailed, but it can be simplified into a sequence of behaviors as follows:

1. Unstack b1 from b2
2. Putdown b1
3. Unstack b2 from b3
4. Putdown b2
5. Unstack b3 from b5
6. Putdown b3
7. Pickup b1
8. Stack b1 on b3
9. Pickup b2
10. Stack b2 on b1
11. Pickup b3
12. Stack b3 on b5

This sequence of behaviors represents the optimal plan to achieve the goal state where b1 is on top of b3 and b3 is on top of b5.
