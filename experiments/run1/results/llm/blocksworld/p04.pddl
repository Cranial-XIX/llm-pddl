The optimal plan to solve the problem is:

1. Pickup b3 (arm is now holding b3)
2. Unstack b1 from b4 (arm is now holding b1, b4 is clear)
3. Putdown b1 (arm is now empty, b1 is on the table and clear)
4. Pickup b4 (arm is now holding b4)
5. Stack b4 on top of b2 (arm is now empty, b4 is on top of b2)
6. Pickup b1 (arm is now holding b1)
7. Stack b1 on top of b3 (arm is now empty, b1 is on top of b3)
8. Pickup b2 (arm is now holding b2)
9. Stack b2 on top of b4 (arm is now empty, b2 is on top of b4)

The goal has been achieved.
